# Resolving a conflict

Resolving a conflict
You've added a reminder to the report.md and then switched to the summary-statistics branch.

You remember that you need that extra task from the report in this branch too, so you decide to add it and make a commit.

You're now ready to merge summary-statistics into main but there is a conflict in report.md.

Looks like there was an error when adding the task into report.md in the summary-statistics branch.

You'll need to resolve any conflicts to merge the branches.

Instructions
100 XP
Edit report.md in the nano text editor, removing content from the summary_statistics branch along with any Git conflict syntax
