# Comparing branches

Comparing branches
If you're working across multiple branches then you may want to compare the state of repos between branches from time to time.

You are in the mh_survey repository and would like to compare two branches.

Instructions

Execute a command to compare the alter-report-title and summary-statistics branches.

To compare the `alter-report-title` and `summary-statistics` branches correctly, use this command:

```bash
git diff alter-report-title summary-statistics
```

This will show the differences between the two branches. Make sure that the branch names are spelled and spaced correctly to avoid any errors.
