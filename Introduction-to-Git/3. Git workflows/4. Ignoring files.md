# Ignoring files

Ignoring files
Data analysis often produces temporary or intermediate files that you don't want to save.

You can tell it to stop paying attention to files you don't care about by creating a file in the root directory of your repository called .gitignore and storing a list of wildcard patterns that specify the files you don't want Git to pay attention to.

Which of the following files would not be ignored by a .gitignore that contained the lines:

pdf
*.py
*.log
backup/*

The correct answer is:

**4. `report.pdf`**

### Explanation:

The `.gitignore` file contains the following patterns:
- `pdf` – would ignore files with the exact name `pdf` (not `.pdf`).
- `*.py` – ignores all files ending with `.py`.
- `*.log` – ignores all files ending with `.log`.
- `backup/*` – ignores all files within the `backup/` directory.

Since `report.pdf` does not match any of these patterns, it would **not be ignored**.
