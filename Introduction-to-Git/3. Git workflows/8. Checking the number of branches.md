# Checking the number of branches

Checking the number of branches

To check the number of branches in the `mh_survey` repository, use the following command:

```bash
git branch
```

This will list all branches in the repository. You can then count the branches displayed to determine the correct answer. 

If you’re interested in both local and remote branches, you can use:

```bash
git branch -a
```

This command lists all branches, including those on remote repositories.
