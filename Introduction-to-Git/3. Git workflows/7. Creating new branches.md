# Creating new branches

Creating new branches
You have finalized the data for the mh_survey project, so you can now move on to the report phase. Therefore, you would like to make a new branch called report where you can work on the project report.

The branch needs to be created from the summary-statistics branch, in which you are currently located.

Your task is to finish working on the summary statistics text file, make a commit, then create the report branch.

1
Add the updated summary_statistics.txt to the staging area.
To add the updated `summary_statistics.txt` file to the staging area, use the following command:

```bash
git add summary_statistics.txt
```

This command stages the file, preparing it for the next commit. 

Once this is done, you can proceed to commit the changes and then create the new `report` branch.

2
Make a commit with the log message "Adding age summary statistics".
To commit the staged `summary_statistics.txt` file with the log message, use the following command:

```bash
git commit -m "Adding age summary statistics"
```

This creates a commit with the specified message, capturing the changes made to `summary_statistics.txt`. 

After this, you’ll be ready to create the new `report` branch.

3
Create a new branch called report.
To create a new branch called `report`, use the following command:

```bash
git branch report
```

This command creates the `report` branch based on the current commit in the `summary-statistics` branch. 

If you’d like to switch to the `report` branch immediately after creating it, you can use:

```bash
git checkout -b report
```

This will both create and switch to the new `report` branch in one step.
