# Creating an alias

Creating an alias
As you work with Git more regularly, you will likely notice that you are performing certain tasks repetitively.

In this case, you have noticed that you are often checking which files have been modified and where you are in the workflow.

Therefore, you will change the command used to check the state of files to an alias, allowing you to save time.

2
Run the new alias command to confirm it works.

To create a global alias for the `git status` command, you can use the following command:

```bash
git config --global alias.st status
```

This command sets up `st` as a shortcut for `git status`. Now, instead of typing `git status`, you can simply type:

```bash
git st
```

This will show the status of files in the repository, saving you time when checking modifications and workflow status.
