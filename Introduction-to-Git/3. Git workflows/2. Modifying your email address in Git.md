1
Display all settings.
To display all settings in Git, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git config --list
```

This command will show all Git configuration settings, including the user email and name, as well as other global and repository-specific settings.

Change the email address to I_love_Git@datacamp.com.
To change the email address in Git, use the following command:

```bash
git config --global user.email "I_love_Git@datacamp.com"
```

This sets the email globally for all repositories on your system. If you want to change it only for the current repository, omit `--global`:

```bash
git config user.email "I_love_Git@datacamp.com"
```

You can verify the update by displaying all settings again with:

```bash
git config --list
```

3
Check the --global settings to see if the update has been made.
To check if the global email setting has been updated in Git, you can use this command:

```bash
git config --global --list
```

Or, to see only the email configuration:

```bash
git config --global user.email
```

This will display the email associated with the global Git configuration, allowing you to confirm that it has been updated to `I_love_Git@datacamp.com`.
