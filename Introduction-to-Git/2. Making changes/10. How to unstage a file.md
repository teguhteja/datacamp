Unstage mental_health_survey.csv.

You're right; using `git reset` is another way to unstage a file. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```bash
git reset HEAD mental_health_survey.csv
```

### Explanation:
- **`git reset HEAD <file>`**: This command removes `mental_health_survey.csv` from the staging area, effectively unstaging it. The changes to the file remain in your working directory, so you don't lose any modifications.
- **`HEAD`**: Refers to the current state of the last commit, helping Git know which commit to unstage the file from.

Both `git restore --staged` and `git reset HEAD` can be used to unstage files, and they achieve the same result in this context. Using `git reset` is a more traditional way, while `git restore` is newer and introduced to clarify the intent of the action.

Add 41,M,Yes,No,No,No,Often,Yes to the end of mental_health_survey.csv.

To add the line `41,M,Yes,No,No,No,Often,Yes` to the end of `mental_health_survey.csv`, you can use a text editor or a command in the terminal. Here are the options:

### Option 1: Using a Text Editor
1. Open `mental_health_survey.csv` in your preferred text editor.
2. Scroll to the end of the file.
3. Add the line:
   ```
   41,M,Yes,No,No,No,Often,Yes
   ```
4. Save the file and close the editor.

### Option 2: Using the Terminal (Linux/macOS)
You can append the line using the `echo` command:
```bash
echo "41,M,Yes,No,No,No,Often,Yes" >> mental_health_survey.csv
```

### Explanation:
- **`>>`**: This appends the text to the end of the file without overwriting its existing content.
- **`mental_health_survey.csv`**: The file to which the line is being added.

Using either method will update `mental_health_survey.csv` with the new data at the end.

3
Restage this file.
To restage `mental_health_survey.csv` after adding the new line, use the following command:

```bash
git add mental_health_survey.csv
```

### Explanation:
- **`git add <file>`**: This command stages the file, meaning it adds the changes in `mental_health_survey.csv` to the staging area, preparing it for commit.

After running this command, the modified `mental_health_survey.csv` will be staged and ready to be committed.

4
Make a commit with the log message "Extra participant".

To commit the staged changes with the message "Extra participant", use the following command:

```bash
git commit -m "Extra participant"
```

### Explanation:
- **`git commit -m`**: This commits the changes in the staging area to the repository with a message.
- **`"Extra participant"`**: The commit message describing the change. This message helps track what was done in this commit (in this case, adding an extra participant).

Once this command is executed, your changes will be saved with the specified message.
