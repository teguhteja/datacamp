# Undoing changes to unstaged files

Undoing changes to unstaged files
git reset is useful for unstaging files, but what if you need to undo changes made to a file that is not in the staging area?

You've been working on the report.md file, but have not yet saved the file. You have just realized that the summary statistics changed with the addition of the last participant's data. As a result, you are not ready to add graphs to your report and would like to discard your recent edits.

Your task is to use a Git command that will discard the changes made to report.md, restoring it to the last saved version.

Undo the changes made to report.md.

You're right! Another way to discard changes to an unstaged file is by using `git checkout` (though `git restore` is now the preferred method).

The command to restore `report.md` using `git checkout` would be:

```bash
git checkout -- report.md
```

### Explanation:
- **`git checkout -- <file>`**: This command checks out the version of the file from the last commit (or the current branch) and restores it to that state, discarding any uncommitted changes made to the file.
- **`report.md`**: The file you want to restore to the last committed state.

While `git restore` is the newer and recommended command for this task, `git checkout` still works for undoing changes in this context.
