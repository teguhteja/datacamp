# Viewing a specific commit

Viewing a specific commit
A common workflow with Git is to view all commits, then compare files between a specific commit and the current version of the file.

In this exercise, you will look into the commit history for report.md.

Use a command to display the repo's history.

To show the difference between the latest version of `report.md` and the version in the commit that added a funding source citation reminder, you can use the `git diff` command. Here's how to do it:

### Steps:
1. **Identify the commit hash**: First, use `git log` to find the hash of the commit that added the funding source citation reminder.
   ```bash
   git log
   ```
   Look through the commit messages to identify the relevant commit and copy its hash.

2. **Compare with the latest version**: Use `git diff` with the commit hash to compare the version in that commit with the latest version.
   ```bash
   git diff <commit-hash> -- report.md
   ```
   Replace `<commit-hash>` with the actual hash of the commit you identified in step 1.

### Explanation:
- **`git diff <commit-hash> -- report.md`**: This command shows the differences between the file `report.md` in the specified commit and the working directory's version (the latest version).

This way, you can review what changes have been made to `report.md` since the commit that added the funding source citation reminder.

Show the difference between the latest version of report.md and the version in the commit that added a funding source citation reminder.

```bash
git show 36b761
```


You're right; using a shorter, more manageable commit hash is the way to go.

### Steps to Correctly Compare `report.md`:
1. **Identify the Correct Commit**: Use `git log` to find the appropriate commit with a shorter hash that added the funding source citation reminder.
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```
   This command will display a simplified list of commits. Locate the commit that added the funding source citation reminder and note the first 6-8 characters of its hash.

2. **Use `git diff` with the Short Hash**:
   ```bash
   git diff <short-hash> -- report.md
   ```
   Replace `<short-hash>` with the first 6-8 characters of the hash from the previous step. For example:
   ```bash
   git diff 7f71ea -- report.md
   ```

### Explanation:
- **Using a Short Hash**: Git allows you to use a shortened version of the commit hash (as long as it uniquely identifies the commit) to make commands easier to handle.
- **`git diff <short-hash> -- report.md`**: This shows the differences between `report.md` in the specified commit and the latest version.

Try this, and you should see the correct differences!
