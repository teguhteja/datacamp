# Comparing commits

Comparing commits
Not only can Git be used to check what changed in a specific commit, it also allows you to compare changes between commits!

report.md

mental_health_survey.csv

report.md and mental_health_survey.csv

report.md, summary_statistics.csv, and mental_health_survey.csv

To compare the changes between the fourth most recent commit and the second most recent commit, you can use the following Git command:

```bash
git diff --name-only <commit_hash_4th> <commit_hash_2nd>
```

This command will show the names of the files that were modified between these two commits. To do this, replace `<commit_hash_4th>` and `<commit_hash_2nd>` with the actual commit hashes of the fourth most recent and second most recent commits, respectively.

### Steps to get the commit hashes:
1. Use `git log` to view the commit history and get the hashes of the fourth and second most recent commits.
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```
2. Copy the commit hashes for the commits you're comparing.

After running this command, you will see the files that were modified between the specified commits. Based on the context of your task, the most likely answer could be:

- **report.md and mental_health_survey.csv** (if those were the files modified).
  
But the exact answer depends on the output of the `git diff` command.
