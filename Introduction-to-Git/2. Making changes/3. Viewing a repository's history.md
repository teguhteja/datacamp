# Viewing a repository's history

Viewing a repository's history
Recall that every commit has a unique identifier called a hash.

Git has a command you can use to display all commits made to a repo, along with the hash, author, and time of the commit.

Using the console, run a command to find the hash of the commit that added a summary report file.

To find the hash of the commit that added a summary report file, you can use the `git log` command in the console. Here's how to do it:

```bash
git log --stat
```

This command will display the commit history along with changes made in each commit. You can look through the list to identify the commit that mentions adding a "summary report file." Check the details provided (like commit message or file changes) to find the corresponding hash.

Once you identify the commit, you can pick the correct hash from your options:
- **7f71eade**
- **1182c282**
- **36b761e4**
- **e39ecc89**

Choose the hash that matches the commit that added the summary report file.
