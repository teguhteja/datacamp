# Restoring an old version of a file

Restoring an old version of a file
You previously saw how to use git checkout to undo the changes that you made since the last commit. This command can also be used to go back even further into a file's history and restore versions of that file from an older commit. In this way, you can think of committing as saving your work and checking out as loading that saved version.

Your task is to restore a file to a previous version and update the repo so it contains this as the current version of the file.

Display the last two commits for the report.md file.
To display the last two commits for the `report.md` file, you can use the following Git command:

```bash
git log -n 2 -- report.md
```

### Explanation:
- **`git log`**: This command shows the commit history.
- **`-n 2`**: Limits the output to the last two commits.
- **`-- report.md`**: Filters the log to show only commits that affected the `report.md` file.

This will display the commit hashes, authors, dates, and commit messages for the last two commits related to the `report.md` file.

Use the commit hash to restore the version of report.md committed with the log message "Added summary report file".
```bash
git checkout e39ecc8 report.md
```

To restore the version of `report.md` from the commit with the log message "Added summary report file", you will need to use the commit hash associated with that message. Once you've identified the commit hash from the `git log` output, you can use the following command:

```bash
git checkout <commit_hash> -- report.md
```

### Steps:
1. Use `git log -- report.md` to find the commit hash associated with the "Added summary report file" message.
2. Replace `<commit_hash>` with the actual commit hash (e.g., `7f71eade`).
3. The command will restore `report.md` to the state it was in at that commit.

For example, if the commit hash for "Added summary report file" is `7f71eade`, the command would be:

```bash
git checkout 7f71eade -- report.md
```

This will restore the file to the version in that commit and update the working directory with that version.

3
Put the restored version of report.md into the staging area.
After restoring the version of `report.md` from a previous commit, you can add it to the staging area using the following command:

```bash
git add report.md
```

### Explanation:
- **`git add report.md`**: This command stages the restored version of `report.md`, so it is ready to be committed in the next commit.

Once the file is staged, you can proceed to commit the changes if you're ready.

Commit the restored file with a log message of "Restoring version from commit e39ecc8".
