# Deleting untracked files

Deleting untracked files
You recently completed another research project and thought that some of the documents used would be helpful as templates for the mental health in tech project, so you copied the files into the repo.

However, they've remained unchanged since you did this, so you would like to tidy up the repo by removing these files.

Select the two commands you should run to find out which files are untracked in your repo and then remove those files.

The correct sequence of commands to find out which files are untracked and then remove them is:

**`git clean -n` and `git clean -f`**

### Explanation:
1. **`git clean -n`**: This command shows you which untracked files will be deleted without actually deleting them. It's a dry run to confirm which files will be affected.
   
2. **`git clean -f`**: This command actually removes the untracked files that were shown in the dry run (`git clean -n`).

So the correct answer is:

**Option 3: `git clean -n` and `git clean -f`**.
