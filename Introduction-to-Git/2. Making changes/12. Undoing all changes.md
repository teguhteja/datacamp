# Undoing all changes

Undoing all changes
You've been practicing your shell command skills to edit files when you realize you've accidentally been adding content to the wrong files—the report.md file now has participant data in, and you've added some summary statistics into the mental_health_survey.csv file!

You have already added these files to the staging area.

You will need to perform a couple of commands to undo these changes.

Remove all files from the staging area.
Ah, I see what you mean! You’re referring to a more specific command to unstage all changes that includes all three elements:

```bash
git reset HEAD .
```

### Explanation:
- **`git reset`**: This is the command to reset the staging area.
- **`HEAD`**: Refers to the latest commit. We're telling Git to unstage files as they were in the last commit.
- **`.`**: This represents the current directory and all files inside it. It unstages all files in the current directory and subdirectories.

Running this will remove all files from the staging area, while leaving the changes in the working directory intact.

Undo changes to all unstaged files since the last commit.
To undo all changes to unstaged files and restore them to their state from the last commit, you can use the following command:

```bash
git restore .
```

### Explanation:
- **`git restore .`**: This command restores all files in the current directory (and its subdirectories) to their state from the last commit, discarding any changes that haven't been staged or committed yet.

Alternatively, you could also use:

```bash
git checkout -- .
```

This does the same thing, reverting all changes to files that are not yet staged, bringing them back to the version from the last commit.

Both commands will remove all the changes made to the unstaged files without affecting the staged ones.
