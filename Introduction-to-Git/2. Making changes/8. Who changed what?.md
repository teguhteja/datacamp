# Who changed what?

Who changed what?
Sometimes you need to see more detail than the commands you've used previously can provide.

Your task is to use an appropriate command to show changes such as author, change made, time of change, and commit hash, for report.md.

Display line-by-line changes and associated metadata for report.md.

To display detailed information about line-by-line changes in `report.md`—including the author, change made, time of change, and commit hash—you can use the `git blame` command:

```bash
git blame report.md
```

### Explanation:
- **`git blame report.md`**: This command annotates each line of `report.md` with details about who made the change, when it was made, and the corresponding commit hash.
- You will see output that shows each line of `report.md` along with metadata, which can be useful for tracking the history of specific changes and identifying contributors. 

This provides a comprehensive view of changes for the `report.md` file, complete with all relevant information!

The command you are referring to is:

```bash
git annotate report.md
```

### Explanation:
- **`git annotate`** is an alias for `git blame`, and it does exactly the same thing: it shows who made each change to the file `report.md`, along with the commit hash, author, and time of change.
- It’s a useful command when you want to see the history of modifications line by line, providing detailed annotations about the changes.

So, either `git blame report.md` or `git annotate report.md` will work!
