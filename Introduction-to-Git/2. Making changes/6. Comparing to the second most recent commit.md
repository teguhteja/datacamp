mental_health_survey.csv had three lines added.

report.md had one line added.

mental_health_survey.csv had 47 lines added.

report.md had three lines added.

To find out the changes in the second most recent commit compared to its parent commit, you can use:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

This command will list all recent commits in a condensed format. Note down the hash of the **second most recent commit**.

Next, use:

```bash
git diff <second-most-recent-hash>^ <second-most-recent-hash>
```

### Explanation:
- `<second-most-recent-hash>`: Replace this with the actual hash of the second most recent commit you obtained from `git log --oneline`.
- The `^` symbol specifies the parent commit of the given hash, allowing you to compare the commit with its parent.

### What to Check:
This command will display the differences introduced in the second most recent commit. Examine the output to determine what changes were made to `mental_health_survey.csv` and `report.md`.

### Possible Answers:
Based on the output, you can choose the answer that accurately describes the changes:
1. **mental_health_survey.csv had three lines added.**
2. **report.md had one line added.**
3. **mental_health_survey.csv had 47 lines added.**
4. **report.md had three lines added.**

Review the diff carefully and select the correct description of the changes.

Awesome workâ€”combining git show with a commit hash or HEAD plus the required ~ is a great way to see what happened in a specific commit!
