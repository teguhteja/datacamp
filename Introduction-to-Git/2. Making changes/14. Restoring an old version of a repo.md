# Restoring an old version of a repo

Restoring an old version of a repo
Restoring versions of files can be extremely powerful and useful, particularly if you've made a mistake and can pinpoint when it occurred.

You've been working on the mental health in tech project for a couple of days when you spot an error in the participant data held in mental_health_survey.csv. Since then, you've modified report.md, summary_statistics.csv, and created a references document.

Therefore, you need to restore versions of all of these files to the second to last commit, which is where the error occurred.

Use a command to restore all files to their version located in the commit with a hash starting 7f71eade.

To restore all files to their version in the commit with the hash starting with `7f71eade`, you can use the following Git command:

```bash
git checkout 7f71eade -- .
```

### Explanation:
- **`git checkout`**: This command allows you to check out a specific commit's version of files.
- **`7f71eade`**: This is the commit hash (the start of it is enough to specify the commit).
- **`-- .`**: The `--` tells Git that what follows is a pathspec. The dot (`.`) means "all files" in the current directory and its subdirectories.

This command will restore the files (`mental_health_survey.csv`, `report.md`, `summary_statistics.csv`, and the `references` document) to the version they had in the specified commit, while leaving the commit history and other files intact.
