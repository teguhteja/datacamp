# Handling push conflicts

Handling push conflicts
Remote repos enable collaboration in Git, but it is important to regularly synchronize your local repo.

In this exercise, you'll see what happens when they aren't aligned, and how to deal with this scenario.

2
Pull origin into the local main branch, entering a message of your choice inside the text editor.
3
Try again to update the remote with changes made in the local main.

Here's how to handle push conflicts and sync your local and remote repositories:

### Step 1: Push Local Changes to the Remote Repo
```bash
git push origin main
```
This command attempts to send your local `main` branch changes to the remote `origin` repo. If there is a conflict, it will notify you.

### Step 2: Pull Changes from the Remote `origin` into the Local `main` Branch
```bash
git pull origin main
```
This will pull the latest changes from the remote `origin` into your local `main` branch. Git will open the default text editor for you to enter a commit message to merge the changes.

Enter a message describing the merge, for example:
```
Merge changes from origin into local main
```

### Step 3: Push the Updated Local Branch to the Remote Repo
```bash
git push origin main
```
After successfully merging the changes from the remote `origin` repo, this command will now push your local updates to the remote `origin` repo.
