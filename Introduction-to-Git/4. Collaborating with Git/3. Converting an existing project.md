Turn your project into a Git repo.

To convert your existing `mh_survey` project into a Git repository, follow these steps:

### Step-by-step Instructions:

1. **Initialize a Git Repository**:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
   This command initializes a new Git repository in the `mh_survey` directory.

2. **Stage All Existing Files**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   The `git add .` command stages all files and directories in the current folder for the initial commit.

3. **Commit the Changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit of the mental health survey project"
   ```
   This creates the first commit with a message describing the changes.

### Next Steps:
- You can now start using Git to track your changes and collaborate more efficiently!
