Here are the steps to set up your new Git repo and create the `todo.txt` file:

### Step-by-step Instructions:

1. **Create a Git Repository**:
   ```bash
   git init anxiety_workplace
   ```
   This command will create a new Git repository named `anxiety_workplace` in your current directory.

2. **Move into the New Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd anxiety_workplace
   ```
   This will navigate into the `anxiety_workplace` directory.

3. **Create the `todo.txt` File**:
   ```bash
   echo "TODO: Recap on existing research." > todo.txt
   ```
   This command will create a `todo.txt` file and add the text "TODO: Recap on existing research." to it.

### Next Steps:
You can now check the contents of your directory or start adding more files to the repo!
