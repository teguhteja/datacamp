# Fetching from a remote

Fetching from a remote
If you are not sure how the contents of a remote repo compare to your local repo, then you can gather the remote contents from a specific branch and then compare them to your local branch.

Your colleague John has set up a remote repo so that his work is backed up in the cloud and accessible to others.

2
Gather contents from the remote origin repo into your local main branch.
3
Compare the remote repo with your local main branch.

Here's how you can complete each of the tasks:

### Step 1: Find the Name(s) of Remote Repos
```bash
git remote -v
```
This command will list all the remote repositories linked to your project and their URLs.

### Step 2: Fetch Contents from the Remote `origin` Repo
```bash
git fetch origin
```
This command gathers the contents from the remote `origin` repo, updating your local copy with the latest changes from the remote without merging them into your working branch yet.

### Step 3: Compare the Remote Repo with Your Local `main` Branch
```bash
git diff main origin/main
```
This command will show the differences between your local `main` branch and the `main` branch on the remote `origin` repo, helping you see any changes that need to be synchronized.

To compare your local `main` branch with the `main` branch on the remote `origin` repo, use the following command:

```bash
git diff origin/main main
```

This command will display the differences between the `main` branch on the remote `origin` and your local `main` branch. This way, you can see what changes have been made in the remote branch compared to your local one.
