Cloning a repo
Your colleague has been working on the new anxiety in the workplace project and is ready to hand it over to you.

They tell you that all of their work is in a repo in /home/john/repo.

Use a single command to clone this repo inside your projects directory, where you are currently located, naming it as john_anxiety_project.
