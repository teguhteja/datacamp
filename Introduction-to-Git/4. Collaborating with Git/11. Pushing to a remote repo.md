# Pushing to a remote repo

Pushing to a remote repo
You've noticed that the budget tracker has some errors, so you decide this needs to be added to the issue_log.txt file, along with adding an action to report.md.

You want to push the updated files to John's remote repo called origin so he is aware of the issue and the next steps.

2
Save changes with the log message "Budget inaccuracy added to the issue log and report".
3
Update the origin remote with changes made in your local main branch.

Here are the steps to complete the task:

### Step 1: Add the Two Updated Files to the Staging Area
Assuming the files are `issue_log.txt` and `report.md`, you can add them with the following command:
```bash
git add issue_log.txt report.md
```

### Step 2: Save Changes with the Log Message
```bash
git commit -m "Budget inaccuracy added to the issue log and report"
```
This commits the changes to `issue_log.txt` and `report.md` with the specified message.

### Step 3: Push the Changes to the `origin` Remote Repo
```bash
git push origin main
```
This command pushes your local `main` branch changes to the `origin` remote repo, updating it with the new commit.
