# Pulling from a remote

Pulling from a remote
Fetching is useful, but if you want to bring your local repo's main branch in line with a remote repo, origin, this is possible with a single command!

In this exercise, you'll work on a file while synchronizing between local and remote repos.

4
Make a commit with the log message "Updating eligibility criteria".


Here are the steps to pull from the remote and update your file:

### Step 1: Fetch and Merge the `origin` Repo
```bash
git pull origin main
```
This command fetches the latest changes from the `origin` repository and merges them into your local `main` branch.

### Step 2: Append Text to `protocol.md`
You can use a text editor or the following command to add the line:
```bash
echo "No existing mental health diagnosis." >> protocol.md
```
This appends the specified text to the end of `protocol.md`.

### Step 3: Add `protocol.md` to the Staging Area
```bash
git add protocol.md
```
This stages the changes made to `protocol.md`.

### Step 4: Commit the Changes with a Log Message
```bash
git commit -m "Updating eligibility criteria"
```
This creates a commit with the message "Updating eligibility criteria".
