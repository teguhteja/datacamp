What is going to be committed?

You have been put in the mh_survey repo, where data/mental_health_survey.csv has been added to the staging area.

Note: if the terminal output does not fit on your screen, you can scroll down using Enter and quit the view using q.

Use a command to see how all files differ from the last saved revision.
You're right! To compare your current files with the latest commit using the `-r` flag, use:

```bash
git diff -r HEAD
```

This command compares all changes between your current working directory and the latest commit (HEAD). It will show you the differences for all tracked files in the repository. Let me know if you have any more questions!

Use a Git command to add only report.md to the staging area.
To add only `report.md` to the staging area, use the following command:

```bash
git add report.md
```

This will stage `report.md` without affecting any other files in the working directory. Let me know if you need any more assistance!

Commit all files with the log message "New participant data and reminder for analysis".
To commit all staged files with the log message, use the following command:

```bash
git commit -m "New participant data and reminder for analysis"
```

This command saves the changes in the staging area with the specified commit message. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
