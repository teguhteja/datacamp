Add all files in your current directory and all subdirectories into the staging area.
To add all files in your current directory and all subdirectories into the staging area, use the following command:

```bash
git add .
```

The `.` signifies the current directory and all its contents. This will stage all modified and new files for the next commit. Let me know if you need further assistance!

To commit all staged files with the log message, use the following command:

```bash
git commit -m "Added 3 participants and a new section in report"
```
