# Importing Stata files

Importing Stata files
Here, you'll gain expertise in importing Stata files as DataFrames using the pd.read_stata() function from pandas. The last exercise's file, 'disarea.dta', is still in your working directory.

Use pd.read_stata() to load the file 'disarea.dta' into the DataFrame df.
Print the head of the DataFrame df.
Visualize your results by plotting a histogram of the column disa10. We’ve already provided this code for you, so just run it!

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Load Stata file into a pandas DataFrame: df


# Print the head of the DataFrame df


# Plot histogram of one column of the DataFrame
pd.DataFrame.hist(df[['disa10']])
plt.xlabel('Extent of disease')
plt.ylabel('Number of countries')
plt.show()

Here’s the complete code to import the Stata file and plot the histogram as described:

```python
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load Stata file into a pandas DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_stata('disarea.dta')

# Print the head of the DataFrame df
print(df.head())

# Plot histogram of one column of the DataFrame
pd.DataFrame.hist(df[['disa10']])
plt.xlabel('Extent of disease')
plt.ylabel('Number of countries')
plt.show()
```

This code loads the `disarea.dta` file, displays the first few rows of `df` to confirm import, and then visualizes the `disa10` column as a histogram.
