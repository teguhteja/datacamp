# Extracting data from your HDF5 file

Extracting data from your HDF5 file
In this exercise, you'll extract some of the LIGO experiment's actual data from the HDF5 file and you'll visualize it.

To do so, you'll need to first explore the HDF5 group 'strain'.

Instructions
100 XP
Assign the HDF5 group data['strain'] to group.
In the for loop, print out the keys of the HDF5 group in group.
Assign the time series data data['strain']['Strain'] to a NumPy array called strain.
Set num_samples equal to 10000, the number of time points we wish to sample.
Execute the rest of the code to produce a plot of the time series data in LIGO_data.hdf5.

```py
# Get the HDF5 group: group


# Check out keys of group
for key in ____:
    print(____)

# Set variable equal to time series data: strain


# Set number of time points to sample: num_samples


# Set time vector
time = np.arange(0, 1, 1/num_samples)

# Plot data
plt.plot(time, strain[:num_samples])
plt.xlabel('GPS Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('strain')
plt.show()



```

Hereâ€™s the completed code to extract and plot the strain data from the HDF5 file:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import h5py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assign filename and load the file
file = 'LIGO_data.hdf5'
data = h5py.File(file, 'r')

# Get the HDF5 group: group
group = data['strain']

# Check out keys of group
for key in group.keys():
    print(key)

# Set variable equal to time series data: strain
strain = np.array(group['Strain'])

# Set number of time points to sample: num_samples
num_samples = 10000

# Set time vector
time = np.arange(0, 1, 1/num_samples)

# Plot data
plt.plot(time, strain[:num_samples])
plt.xlabel('GPS Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('Strain')
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:
1. **data['strain']**: Accesses the `strain` group in the HDF5 file.
2. **for key in group.keys()**: Lists the keys within the `strain` group, showing available datasets.
3. **np.array(group['Strain'])**: Converts the `Strain` dataset to a NumPy array.
4. **num_samples**: Specifies the number of points (10,000) for plotting.
5. **time vector**: Sets the `time` array to span 0 to 1 second in 10,000 steps.
6. **Plotting**: Displays a plot of `strain` over time with labeled axes.

This code will help visualize the strain data over a 1-second period.
