Using read_stata to import Stata files
The pandas package has been imported in the environment as pd and the file disarea.dta is in your working directory. The data consist of disease extents for several diseases in various countries (more information can be found here).

df = 'disarea.dta'

df = read_stata.pd('disarea.dta')

df = pd.read_stata('disarea.dta')

df = pd.read_stata(disarea.dta)

The correct way to use the `read_stata()` function to import `disarea.dta` into the object `df` is:

```python
df = pd.read_stata('disarea.dta')
```

This option works because it calls the `read_stata()` function from the pandas package (`pd`) and correctly passes the filename as a string.
