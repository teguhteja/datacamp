# Listing sheets in Excel files

Listing sheets in Excel files
Whether you like it or not, any working data scientist will need to deal with Excel spreadsheets at some point in time. You won't always want to do so in Excel, however!

Here, you'll learn how to use pandas to import Excel spreadsheets and how to list the names of the sheets in any loaded .xlsx file.

Recall from the video that, given an Excel file imported into a variable spreadsheet, you can retrieve a list of the sheet names using the attribute spreadsheet.sheet_names.

Specifically, you'll be loading and checking out the spreadsheet 'battledeath.xlsx', modified from the Peace Research Institute Oslo's (PRIO) dataset. This data contains age-adjusted mortality rates due to war in various countries over several years.

Assign the spreadsheet filename (provided above) to the variable file.
Pass the correct argument to pd.ExcelFile() to load the file using pandas, assigning the result to the variable xls.
Print the sheetnames of the Excel spreadsheet by passing the necessary argument to the print() function.

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Assign spreadsheet filename: file
file = ____

# Load spreadsheet: xls
xls = pd.ExcelFile(____)

# Print sheet names
print(____)


Hereâ€™s how you can list the sheets in an Excel file using pandas:

### Instructions to complete the code:
1. **Assign the filename** of the Excel file to a variable.
2. **Load the Excel file** into a pandas `ExcelFile` object.
3. **Print the sheet names** from the loaded Excel file.

```python
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Assign spreadsheet filename: file
file = 'battledeath.xlsx'

# Load spreadsheet: xls
xls = pd.ExcelFile(file)

# Print sheet names
print(xls.sheet_names)
```

### Key points:
- The variable `file` stores the name of the Excel file.
- `pd.ExcelFile(file)` loads the spreadsheet, allowing you to access its properties, including the names of the sheets.
- `xls.sheet_names` retrieves a list of all the sheet names in the Excel file.
