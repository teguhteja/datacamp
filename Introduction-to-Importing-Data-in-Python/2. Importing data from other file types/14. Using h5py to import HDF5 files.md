# Using h5py to import HDF5 files

Using h5py to import HDF5 files
The file 'LIGO_data.hdf5' is already in your working directory. In this exercise, you'll import it using the h5py library. You'll also print out its datatype to confirm you have imported it correctly. You'll then study the structure of the file in order to see precisely what HDF groups it contains.

You can find the LIGO data plus loads of documentation and tutorials here. There is also a great tutorial on Signal Processing with the data here.

Instructions
100 XP
Import the package h5py.
Assign the name of the file to the variable file.
Load the file as read only into the variable data.
Print the datatype of data.
Print the names of the groups in the HDF5 file 'LIGO_data.hdf5'.

```py
# Import packages
import numpy as np
import ____

# Assign filename: file


# Load file: data
data = h5py.File(____, ____)

# Print the datatype of the loaded file


# Print the keys of the file
for key in ____:
    print(____)


```


Here's the completed code with step-by-step instructions:

1. **Import the h5py library** for handling HDF5 files.
2. **Set the filename** for the HDF5 file.
3. **Load the file in read-only mode** to avoid accidental modifications.
4. **Print the datatype** of the loaded data to verify it's an HDF5 file.
5. **Loop through and print** each key to see the groups in the file.

```python
# Import packages
import numpy as np
import h5py

# Assign filename: file
file = 'LIGO_data.hdf5'

# Load file: data
data = h5py.File(file, 'r')

# Print the datatype of the loaded file
print(type(data))

# Print the keys of the file
for key in data.keys():
    print(key)
```

### Explanation:
- **h5py.File(file, 'r')**: Opens the file in read-only mode.
- **data.keys()**: Retrieves all group names (or datasets) in the HDF5 file, letting you explore its structure.

This will confirm the file is loaded correctly and display the structure of the file.
