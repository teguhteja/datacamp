h5py_data = File(h5py_file, 'r')

h5py_data = h5py.File(h5py_file, 'r')

h5py_data = h5py.File(h5py_file, read)

h5py_data = h5py.File(h5py_file, 'read')

The correct answer is:

**`h5py_data = h5py.File(h5py_file, 'r')`**

Explanation:
- `h5py.File()` is the function used to open HDF5 files with the `h5py` package.
- The `'r'` argument specifies "read-only" mode.
