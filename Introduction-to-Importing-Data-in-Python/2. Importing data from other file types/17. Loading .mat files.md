# Loading .mat files

Loading .mat files
In this exercise, you'll figure out how to load a MATLAB file using scipy.io.loadmat() and you'll discover what Python datatype it yields.

The file 'albeck_gene_expression.mat' is in your working directory. This file contains gene expression data from the Albeck Lab at UC Davis.

Instructions
100 XP
Import the package scipy.io.
Load the file 'albeck_gene_expression.mat' into the variable mat; do so using the function scipy.io.loadmat().
Use the function type() to print the datatype of mat to the shell.

py
# Import package


# Load MATLAB file: mat


# Print the datatype type of mat
print(____)

Here's the completed code to load the MATLAB file and check its datatype:

```python
# Import package
import scipy.io

# Load MATLAB file: mat
mat = scipy.io.loadmat('albeck_gene_expression.mat')

# Print the datatype of mat
print(type(mat))
```

### Explanation:
1. **scipy.io.loadmat()**: Loads the MATLAB file as a dictionary-like object.
2. **type(mat)**: Displays the datatype of `mat`, which is typically a dictionary (`dict`). This dictionary will contain variables from the MATLAB file, with variable names as keys and data arrays as values.

After running this code, youâ€™ll see that `mat` is a dictionary, allowing you to access the MATLAB variables by key.
