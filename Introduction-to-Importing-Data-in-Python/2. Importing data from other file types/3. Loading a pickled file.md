# Loading a pickled file

Loading a pickled file
There are a number of datatypes that cannot be saved easily to flat files, such as lists and dictionaries. If you want your files to be human readable, you may want to save them as text files in a clever manner. JSONs, which you will see in a later chapter, are appropriate for Python dictionaries.

However, if you merely want to be able to import them into Python, you can serialize them. All this means is converting the object into a sequence of bytes, or a bytestream.

In this exercise, you'll import the pickle package, open a previously pickled data structure from a file and load it.

Instructions
100 XP
Import the pickle package.
Complete the second argument of open() so that it is read only for a binary file. This argument will be a string of two letters, one signifying 'read only', the other 'binary'.
Pass the correct argument to pickle.load(); it should use the variable that is bound to open.
Print the data, d.
Print the datatype of d; take your mind back to your previous use of the function type().

# Import pickle package


# Open pickle file and load data: d
with open('data.pkl', ____) as file:
    d = pickle.load(____)

# Print d
print(____)

# Print datatype of d
print(____)

Hereâ€™s how you can load a pickled file:

### Instructions to complete the code:
1. **Import the `pickle` package**.
2. **Open the file** in read-only (`'rb'`) mode for binary.
3. **Use `pickle.load()`** to load the data from the file.
4. **Print the data** and the datatype of the loaded object.

```python
# Import pickle package
import pickle

# Open pickle file and load data: d
with open('data.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    d = pickle.load(file)

# Print d
print(d)

# Print datatype of d
print(type(d))
```

### Key points:
- The `'rb'` argument in `open()` specifies the file is opened in read and binary mode.
- `pickle.load()` deserializes the pickled object from the file back into its original Python object.
