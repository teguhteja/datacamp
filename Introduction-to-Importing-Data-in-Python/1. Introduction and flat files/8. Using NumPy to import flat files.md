# Using NumPy to import flat files

Using NumPy to import flat files
In this exercise, you're now going to load the MNIST digit recognition dataset using the numpy function loadtxt() and see just how easy it can be:

The first argument will be the filename.
The second will be the delimiter which, in this case, is a comma.
The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, frequently used in the field of machine learning. It serves as a benchmark for evaluating algorithm performance in recognizing and classifying these numbers.

Instructions
100 XP
Fill in the arguments of np.loadtxt() by passing file and a comma ',' for the delimiter.
Fill in the argument of print() to print the type of the object digits. Use the function type().
Execute the rest of the code to visualize one of the rows of the data.

# Import packages
import numpy as np

# Assign filename to variable: file
file = 'digits.csv'

# Load file as array: digits
digits = np.loadtxt(____, delimiter='____')

# Print datatype of digits
print(____)

# Select and reshape a row
im = digits[21, 1:]
im_sq = np.reshape(im, (28, 28))

# Plot reshaped data (matplotlib.pyplot already loaded as plt)
plt.imshow(im_sq, cmap='Greys', interpolation='nearest')
plt.show()

Here's how to complete the code for loading the MNIST dataset using NumPy's `loadtxt()` function:

```python
# Import packages
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Make sure to import matplotlib if it's not already imported

# Assign filename to variable: file
file = 'digits.csv'

# Load file as array: digits
digits = np.loadtxt(file, delimiter=',')

# Print datatype of digits
print(type(digits))

# Select and reshape a row
im = digits[21, 1:]
im_sq = np.reshape(im, (28, 28))

# Plot reshaped data (matplotlib.pyplot already loaded as plt)
plt.imshow(im_sq, cmap='Greys', interpolation='nearest')
plt.show()
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **np.loadtxt()**: This function loads the data from the specified CSV file, using a comma as the delimiter to separate values.
  - `file`: The filename variable containing the path to the dataset.
  - `delimiter=','`: Specifies that the values in the CSV file are separated by commas.
  
- **print(type(digits))**: This prints the data type of the loaded array, which should be a NumPy array (`<class 'numpy.ndarray'>`).

- The code then selects the 21st row (index 21) from the `digits` array, ignoring the first column (which typically contains labels) by using `digits[21, 1:]`. It reshapes this row into a 28x28 array to prepare it for visualization.

- Finally, it uses Matplotlib to display the reshaped image as a grayscale image.
