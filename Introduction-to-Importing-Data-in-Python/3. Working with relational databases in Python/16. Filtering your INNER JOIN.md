# Filtering your INNER JOIN

Filtering your INNER JOIN
Congrats on performing your first INNER JOIN! You're now going to finish this chapter with one final exercise in which you perform an INNER JOIN and filter the result using a WHERE clause.

Recall that to INNER JOIN the Orders and Customers tables from the Northwind database, Hugo executed the following SQL query:

"SELECT OrderID, CompanyName FROM Orders INNER JOIN Customers on Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID"
The following code has already been executed to import the necessary packages and to create the engine:

import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')

Use the pandas function read_sql_query() to assign to the variable df the DataFrame of results from the following query: select all records from PlaylistTrack INNER JOIN Track on PlaylistTrack.TrackId = Track.TrackId that satisfy the condition Milliseconds < 250000.


```py
# Execute query and store records in DataFrame: df


# Print head of DataFrame
print(df.head())
```

Hereâ€™s how you can execute the INNER JOIN between the `PlaylistTrack` and `Track` tables, filtering for records where `Milliseconds` is less than 250,000, and store the results in a DataFrame using the `read_sql_query()` function from pandas:

```python
# Import packages
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')

# Execute query and store records in DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_sql_query("""
    SELECT * 
    FROM PlaylistTrack 
    INNER JOIN Track ON PlaylistTrack.TrackId = Track.TrackId 
    WHERE Track.Milliseconds < 250000
""", engine)

# Print head of DataFrame
print(df.head())
```

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query**: The SQL statement selects all records from the `PlaylistTrack` table, INNER JOINs it with the `Track` table based on the `TrackId`, and applies a `WHERE` clause to filter results where the `Milliseconds` column is less than 250,000.
2. **Using `read_sql_query()`**: This function simplifies the process by directly executing the SQL query and returning the result as a pandas DataFrame, which is stored in `df`.
3. **Displaying Results**: Finally, `print(df.head())` shows the first few rows of the resulting DataFrame.

This code allows you to filter the results of your INNER JOIN based on specific conditions, demonstrating the power of SQL in conjunction with pandas.
