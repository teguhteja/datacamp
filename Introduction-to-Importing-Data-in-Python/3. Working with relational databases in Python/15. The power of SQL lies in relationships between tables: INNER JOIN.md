# The power of SQL lies in relationships between tables: INNER JOIN

The power of SQL lies in relationships between tables: INNER JOIN
Here, you'll perform your first INNER JOIN! You'll be working with your favourite SQLite database, Chinook.sqlite. For each record in the Album table, you'll extract the Title along with the Name of the Artist. The latter will come from the Artist table and so you will need to INNER JOIN these two tables on the ArtistID column of both.

Recall that to INNER JOIN the Orders and Customers tables from the Northwind database, Hugo executed the following SQL query:

"SELECT OrderID, CompanyName FROM Orders INNER JOIN Customers on Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID"
The following code has already been executed to import the necessary packages and to create the engine:

import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')

Assign to rs the results from the following query: select all the records, extracting the Title of the record and Name of the artist of each record from the Album table and the Artist table, respectively. To do so, INNER JOIN these two tables on the ArtistID column of both.
In a call to pd.DataFrame(), apply the method fetchall() to rs in order to fetch all records in rs. Store them in the DataFrame df.
Set the DataFrame's column names to the corresponding names of the table columns.

```py
# Open engine in context manager
# Perform query and save results to DataFrame: df
with engine.connect() as con:
    ____
    ____
    ____

# Print head of DataFrame df
print(df.head())


```

Here's the completed code to perform an INNER JOIN between the `Album` and `Artist` tables in the `Chinook.sqlite` database, extracting the `Title` from the `Album` table and the `Name` from the `Artist` table:

```python
# Open engine in context manager
with engine.connect() as con:
    # Perform query: selecting Title from Album and Name from Artist
    rs = con.execute("""
        SELECT Album.Title, Artist.Name 
        FROM Album 
        INNER JOIN Artist ON Album.ArtistId = Artist.ArtistId
    """)
    
    # Fetch all records in rs and store in DataFrame: df
    df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall())
    
    # Set the DataFrame's column names
    df.columns = rs.keys()

# Print head of DataFrame df
print(df.head())
```

### Explanation:
1. **Connecting to the Database**: The `with engine.connect() as con:` statement opens a context manager for connecting to the SQLite database.
2. **Executing the INNER JOIN Query**: The SQL query selects the `Title` from the `Album` table and the `Name` from the `Artist` table, using an INNER JOIN on the `ArtistId` column from both tables.
3. **Fetching Records**: The results of the query are fetched with `rs.fetchall()` and stored in the DataFrame `df`.
4. **Setting Column Names**: The DataFrame's column names are set to the corresponding names from the query results using `rs.keys()`.
5. **Displaying Results**: Finally, `print(df.head())` displays the first few rows of the DataFrame, allowing you to view the results of the join.

This code effectively demonstrates how to use SQL INNER JOIN to combine data from two related tables in a relational database.
