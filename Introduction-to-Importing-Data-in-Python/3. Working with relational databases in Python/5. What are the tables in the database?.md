# What are the tables in the database?

What are the tables in the database?
In this exercise, you'll once again create an engine to connect to 'Chinook.sqlite'. Before you can get any data out of the database, however, you'll need to know what tables it contains!

To this end, you'll save the table names to a list using the method .table_names() on the engine and then you will print the list.

Instructions

Import the function create_engine from the module sqlalchemy.
Create an engine to connect to the SQLite database 'Chinook.sqlite' and assign it to engine.
Using the method .table_names() on the engine engine, assign the table names of 'Chinook.sqlite' to the variable table_names.
Print the object table_names to the shell.

```py
# Import necessary module


# Create engine: engine


# Save the table names to a list: table_names


# Print the table names to the shell
print(____)


```

Here's the completed code to list the tables in the `Chinook.sqlite` database:

```python
# Import necessary module
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')

# Save the table names to a list: table_names
table_names = engine.table_names()

# Print the table names to the shell
print(table_names)
```

### Explanation:
1. **engine.table_names()**: Retrieves the list of all tables in the database connected by `engine`.
2. **print(table_names)**: Displays the table names, giving an overview of the database structure.

Running this code will output the table names in `Chinook.sqlite`, showing available data tables in the database.
