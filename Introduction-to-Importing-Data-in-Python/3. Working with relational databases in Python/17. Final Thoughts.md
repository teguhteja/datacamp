These skills will get you a long way in using Python to import data from relational databases. In fact, having made it through this course, you're now well-equipped to import all types of files in Python, from plain text to flat files, Excel to Matlab, among many others. Well done! But that doesn't mean there's not more to be learnt. What about importing data from the web, where so much of it is??

In the sequel to this, you'll learn how to import web-data. It's a short course and will equip you to import data from the world wide web and pull data from Application Programming Interfaces, also known as APIs. You'll take a deep dive into the Twitter streaming API, which allows us to stream real-time tweets. I'm sure that you're itching to get your hands dirty with web data;

4. Let's practice!
