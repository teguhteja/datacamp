# The Hello World of SQL Queries!

The Hello World of SQL Queries!
Now, it's time for liftoff! In this exercise, you'll perform the Hello World of SQL queries, SELECT, in order to retrieve all columns of the table Album in the Chinook database. Recall that the query SELECT * selects all columns.

Instructions

Open the engine connection as con using the method .connect() on the engine.
Execute the query that selects ALL columns from the Album table. Store the results in rs.
Store all of your query results in the DataFrame df by applying the .fetchall() method to the results rs.
Close the connection!

```py
# Import packages
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd

# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')

# Open engine connection: con


# Perform query: rs
rs = con.execute(____)

# Save results of the query to DataFrame: df
df = pd.DataFrame(____)

# Close connection


# Print head of DataFrame df
print(df.head())


```

Hereâ€™s the completed code to execute a basic SQL query and retrieve data from the `Album` table in the `Chinook.sqlite` database:

```python
# Import packages
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd

# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')

# Open engine connection: con
con = engine.connect()

# Perform query: rs
rs = con.execute("SELECT * FROM Album")

# Save results of the query to DataFrame: df
df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall())

# Close connection
con.close()

# Print head of DataFrame df
print(df.head())
```

### Explanation:
1. **con = engine.connect()**: Opens a connection to the database.
2. **rs = con.execute("SELECT * FROM Album")**: Executes a query to select all columns from the `Album` table.
3. **rs.fetchall()**: Retrieves all rows returned by the query.
4. **pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall())**: Converts query results to a DataFrame for easy analysis.
5. **con.close()**: Closes the connection to free up resources.

To include column names, update `df` creation to use `df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall(), columns=rs.keys())`.
