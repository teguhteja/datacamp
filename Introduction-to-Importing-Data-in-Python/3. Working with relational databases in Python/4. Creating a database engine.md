# Creating a database engine

Creating a database engine
Here, you're going to fire up your very first SQL engine. You'll create an engine to connect to the SQLite database 'Chinook.sqlite', which is in your working directory. Remember that to create an engine to connect to 'Northwind.sqlite', Hugo executed the command

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Northwind.sqlite')
Here, 'sqlite:///Northwind.sqlite' is called the connection string to the SQLite database Northwind.sqlite. A little bit of background on the Chinook database: the Chinook database contains information about a semi-fictional digital media store in which media data is real and customer, employee and sales data has been manually created.

Why the name Chinook, you ask? According to their website,

The name of this sample database was based on the Northwind database. Chinooks are winds in the interior West of North America, where the Canadian Prairies and Great Plains meet various mountain ranges. Chinooks are most prevalent over southern Alberta in Canada. Chinook is a good name choice for a database that intends to be an alternative to Northwind.

Instructions

Import the function create_engine from the module sqlalchemy.
Create an engine to connect to the SQLite database 'Chinook.sqlite' and assign it to engine.

```py
# Import necessary module
from ____ import ____

# Create engine: engine



```

Here's the completed code to create a database engine for connecting to the SQLite database `Chinook.sqlite`:

```python
# Import necessary module
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')
```

### Explanation:
- **create_engine**: This function from SQLAlchemy creates a connection to a database using the provided connection string.
- **'sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite'**: Specifies the path to the SQLite database file. The `sqlite:///` prefix tells SQLAlchemy to use SQLite as the database engine.

With this setup, `engine` will serve as a gateway for executing SQL queries on the `Chinook.sqlite` database.
