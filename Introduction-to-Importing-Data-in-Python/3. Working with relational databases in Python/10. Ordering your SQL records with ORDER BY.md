# Ordering your SQL records with ORDER BY

Ordering your SQL records with ORDER BY
You can also order your SQL query results. For example, if you wanted to get all records from the Customer table of the Chinook database and order them in increasing order by the column SupportRepId, you could do so with the following query:

"SELECT * FROM Customer ORDER BY SupportRepId"
In fact, you can order any SELECT statement by any column.

In this interactive exercise, you'll select all records of the Employee table and order them in increasing order by the column BirthDate.

Packages are already imported as follows:

import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

Using the function create_engine(), create an engine for the SQLite database Chinook.sqlite and assign it to the variable engine.
In the context manager, execute the query that selects all records from the Employee table and orders them in increasing order by the column BirthDate. Assign the result to rs.
In a call to pd.DataFrame(), apply the method fetchall() to rs in order to fetch all records in rs. Store them in the DataFrame df.
Set the DataFrame's column names to the corresponding names of the table columns.


```py
# Create engine: engine


# Open engine in context manager
with engine.connect() as con:
    rs = ____
    df = ____

    # Set the DataFrame's column names


# Print head of DataFrame
print(df.head())


```

Here's the completed code to select all records from the `Employee` table and order them by the `BirthDate` column in increasing order:

```python
# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')

# Open engine in context manager
with engine.connect() as con:
    # Execute the SQL query and order by BirthDate
    rs = con.execute("SELECT * FROM Employee ORDER BY BirthDate")
    
    # Fetch all records and store them in DataFrame df
    df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall())
    
    # Set the DataFrame's column names
    df.columns = rs.keys()

# Print head of DataFrame
print(df.head())
```

### Explanation:
1. **engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')**: Establishes a connection to the `Chinook.sqlite` database.
2. **rs = con.execute("SELECT * FROM Employee ORDER BY BirthDate")**: Executes a query to select all records from the `Employee` table, ordering the results by the `BirthDate` column in ascending order.
3. **df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall())**: Retrieves all the results from `rs` and stores them in a DataFrame called `df`.
4. **df.columns = rs.keys()**: Sets the column names of the DataFrame to match the column names from the SQL query.

This code will output the first few records of employees, ordered by their birth dates.
