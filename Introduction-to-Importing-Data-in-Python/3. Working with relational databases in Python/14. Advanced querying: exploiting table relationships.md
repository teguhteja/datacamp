# Advanced querying: exploiting table relationships

1. Advanced querying: exploiting table relationships
00:00 - 00:20
By now, you have become familiar with querying individual tables of databases, such as the 'Orders' table of the Northwind database. You will remember, however, that much of the power of relational databases stems from the fact that they can capture relationships between tables: the tables are linked!

2. Tables are linked
00:20 - 00:28
For example, as we saw earlier, the 'Orders' table of the the Northwind Traders database has both a column called

00:28 - 00:34
'CustomerID' and one called 'EmployeeID', columns which correspond precisely to the

4. Tables are linked
00:34 - 00:48
primary keys in the 'Customers' and 'Employees' tables, respectively. This means that, given an Order, you can immediately look up the details of the relevant Customer or Employee in the appropriate table.

5. JOINing tables
00:48 - 01:10
Now what if you want to incorporate such information into your query? For example, if you want to query the 'Orders' table and include, for each Order, information about the corresponding Customer from the 'Customers' table? A specific illustrative example will go a long way here: let's say that we wanted, for each Order, to get the

OrderID and the

01:12 - 01:29
CompanyName of the Customer. The OrderID lives in the 'Orders' table while the CompanyName lives in the 'Customers' table. SQL has a really clever way of doing this: it's called a JOIN because what you're really doing is joining two tables together,

in this case, the 'Orders' and

'Customers' tables. Specifically

10. INNER JOIN in Python (pandas)
01:34 - 02:28
it's an INNER JOIN. There are other types of JOINs which we won't cover here. As it's the CustomerID columns of the 'Orders' and 'Customers' tables that correspond to each, you'll want to JOIN the tables ON these columns and that is precisely what I have done in this code. The notation of dot followed by Column name is merely selecting a column of a table. The table that we are selecting from is "Orders INNER JOIN Customers on Orders dot CustomerID equals Customers dot CustomerID" and I am selecting the OrderID column and the CompanyName column of this new table. I know that that's a bit to take in, but after you get your hands dirty performing some INNER JOINs, you'll be far more comfortable with this advanced querying technique.

It's your turn to query!
