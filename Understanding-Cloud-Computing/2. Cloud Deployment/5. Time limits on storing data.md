# Time limits on storing data

Time limits on storing data
GDPR has regulations on how long data can be stored. Below is an excerpt from the European Commission describing this regulation:

Data must be stored for the shortest time possible. That period should take into account the reasons why your company/organization needs to process the data, as well as any legal obligations to keep the data for a fixed period of time (for example national labour, tax or anti-fraud laws requiring you to keep personal data about your employees for a defined period, product warranty duration, etc.).

Your company/organization should establish time limits to erase or review the data stored.

How could this rule affect a company using cloud computing?

This option aligns with GDPR's requirement for data deletion after a certain time limit, ensuring that even backups and copies in disaster recovery centers are properly managed and erased.
