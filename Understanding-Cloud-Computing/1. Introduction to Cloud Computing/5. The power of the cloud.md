# The power of the cloud

1. The power of the cloud
00:00 - 00:00
Now that you know what cloud computing is, let's look at what makes it so powerful.

2. Cloud services
00:00 - 00:00
Cloud providers offer many services.

3. Cloud services
00:00 - 00:00
The three basic ones are compute, storage, and databases. Compute objects are the brains that will process your workload, like the server in the web hosting example from before. Storage resources save data, and databases store structured data. These services can be combined to build various cloud solutions.

4. Cloud computing characteristics
00:00 - 00:00
Cloud computing has several benefits: virtualization, scalability, cost, speed, performance, growth, reliability, and security.

5. Virtualization
00:00 - 00:00
Virtualization powers cloud computing by splitting a physical server into several virtual servers, each with its own operating system. This efficient use of resources makes the virtualized machine more portable and manageable, reducing the need for physical machines and maximizing server output. This allows cloud providers to operate on economies of scale.

6. Scalability
00:00 - 00:00
With cloud computing, you can easily add and remove resources as needed. For instance, an e-commerce site can handle increased traffic during peak times, like Black Friday, by scaling up resources.

7. Scalability
00:00 - 00:00
There are two types of scaling: vertical and horizontal. Vertical scaling changes the power of an existing instance, while horizontal scaling increases the number of instances, sharing the workload across multiple devices.

8. Cost
00:00 - 00:00
Many cloud services operate on a pay-as-you-go model, where you only pay for the resources used. This eliminates capital expenses for hardware, software, and on-site infrastructure. However, for clear and stable resource needs, an on-premise solution might be more cost-efficient in the long term. The best solution depends on the use case.

9. Speed
00:00 - 00:00
The cloud makes resources available to you almost immediately when you ask for them. This is called on-demand resourcing. There is a fast set-up time and you can deploy technology services in a matter of minutes. No waiting around for hardware to be ordered, installed, cabled, and configured before using it.

10. Performance
00:00 - 00:00
An organization's IT operations and equipment are housed in a facility called a data center. A single on-premise data center, in most cases, cannot compete with the worldwide network of data centers provided by cloud providers. They regularly upgrade to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware.

11. Growth
00:00 - 00:00
With the cloud you can grow using a wide range of resources and services. Because of the on-demand resourcing, growth constraints are significantly reduced. Additionally, you can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes. Most cloud providers allow you to provision resources across their global network.

12. Reliability
00:00 - 00:00
Cloud computing ensures the durability and availability of data and services by replicating data at multiple redundant data centers. If one data center is impacted by a disaster, data remains available elsewhere.

13. Security
00:00 - 00:00
Security is crucial for companies. Choosing a cloud solution involves trusting an external party to secure data. This poses risks, especially in highly regulated sectors like healthcare, government, or finance. However, more cloud providers offer services aligned with these regulations, guaranteeing both physical and virtual security of their data centers.
