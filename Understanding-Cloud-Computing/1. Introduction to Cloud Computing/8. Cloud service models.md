# Cloud service models

1. Cloud service models
00:00 - 00:00
In this video, we'll talk about the different cloud service models.

2. Car analogy
00:00 - 00:00
Cloud computing is like ride sharing. Instead of buying IT infrastructure, companies can "rent" it from a cloud provider, just as you can "rent" a car using an app like Uber or Lyft. This way, you avoid maintenance and fuel costs, paying only for what you use. The ride sharing company benefits from economies of scale by serving many customers.

3. Car analogy
00:00 - 00:00
There are alternatives to owning a car depending on the level of control you want. You could rent a car, use a ride sharing app, or use public transport.

4. On-premise
00:00 - 00:00
Owning a car is similar to the on-premise approach: you're responsible for everything â€” maintenance, insurance, parking, fuel, driving, and finding a route.

5. IaaS
00:00 - 00:00
The first cloud service model is Infrastructure as a Service, or IaaS, is similar to renting a car. The vendor supplies the infrastructure, like the car, while you're responsible for driving and fuel.

6. PaaS
00:00 - 00:00
The next model is Platform as a Service (PaaS), where running costs are also outsourced. You still control the route you take.

7. SaaS
00:00 - 00:00
The final model is Software as a Service (SaaS), where everything is handled by the vendor, like taking a bus.

8. Cloud service models
00:00 - 00:00
In cloud computing terms, IaaS means you "rent" the fundamental building blocks: networking, storage, and servers. PaaS includes the underlying infrastructure plus tools and software needed to build applications, such as operating systems and middleware. SaaS provides software via a web browser or app, with the hardware and OS managed by the vendor.

Let's summarize.

10. Cloud service models
00:00 - 00:00
IaaS offers scalable, cloud-based alternatives to on-premise infrastructure, used by system admins. An example is using a cloud server from a provider.

11. Cloud service models

PaaS provides hardware and software tools over the internet for developing applications, saving developers time. Examples include Google App Engine, Windows Azure, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

12. Cloud service models
00:00 - 00:00
SaaS makes software available online, usually for a monthly fee, eliminating the need for installation. Users access it from any device. Examples include Google G Suite, Microsoft Office 365, and Dropbox. Most businesses use a combination of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.

13. The cloud pyramid
00:00 - 00:00
We can represent the three main cloud service models in a pyramid. As we move up, abstraction increases and control decreases. More abstraction means less detail but easier management. The highest level of abstraction covers the entire system, while lower levels involve fewer components.

14. Other cloud service models
00:00 - 00:00
Another important model is Function as a Service, or FaaS. FaaS is a variation of SaaS focused on single functions, like identity authentication or payment transactions. FaaS uses a "serverless" billing model, meaning you pay for the service rather than renting servers.

15. Other service models
00:00 - 00:00
There are many other service models too. More functionality is being abstracted and offered as cloud service packages. Examples include HaaS, DBaaS, DRaaS, and NaaS. This phenomenon is called XaaS, or Anything as a Service, covering all cloud services available over the internet.
