All right! Let's now talk about Google Cloud.

2. Google Cloud and the market
00:00 - 00:00
Google Cloud acknowledges that multi-cloud - a combination of different cloud provider services - is the future and that consumers don't want to be locked in. In 2019, they launched Google Cloud Anthos, a service that allows customers to manage and deploy workloads across clouds without worrying about the different environments and APIs. In other words, Anthos lets you deploy and run hybrid multi-cloud solutions, combining on-premise servers and several cloud providers all in one place. As of the end of 2023, Google Cloud has a market share of 11%, behind the current leaders in the market, AWS and Microsoft Azure.

10. Google Cloud case study
00:00 - 00:00
It's time for a Google Cloud case study. Lush is a cosmetics retailer manufacturing creams, soaps, and lotions using only vegetarian recipes. A key sales and discount period for the company is Boxing Day, the UK's biggest shopping event following Christmas Day. In recent years, during Boxing Day, they experienced peak demand that caused website outages: their current infrastructure could not handle more than 12 transactions per second. They sought a scalable infrastructure that could provide stability while handling increased traffic. Lush migrated their entire infrastructure to Google Cloud, including mobile apps, e-commerce platforms, and retail systems. This impacted 17 websites as well, on top of migrating customer and product data. The move was done during December, their busiest month of the year. Using Google Cloud Compute Engine, they could rapidly test, modify, deploy, and get feedback while migrating services and meeting tight deadlines. Their data now lives on Google Cloud SQL.

After the migration, Lush survived Boxing Day without any outage, and also experienced a 40% reduction in its hosting costs. They then explored new possibilities offered by Google Cloud. Lush decided to reduce packaging, but the packaging does convey useful information, such as the ingredients or instructions, so they deployed a customer-facing image recognition app to identify their products and provide relevant information.
