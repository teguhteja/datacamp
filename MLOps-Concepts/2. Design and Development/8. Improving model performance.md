# Improving model performance

Improving model performance
You’ve just learned about feature engineering and its crucial role in improving machine learning model performance. Understanding which techniques to apply can make a significant difference.

Suppose you are a junior data scientist working for an e-commerce company on enhancing the recommendation system for recommending the next best product to a customer. After adding several new features to your model, you find that the performance hasn’t improved. Which of the following actions would not be an effective step to address this issue?

2

Sit with a domain expert to evaluate which features could be most important and provide insights on their relevance to the recommendation system.

3

Implement a feature store to centralize and reuse features across projects, ensuring consistency in feature usage.

**Press 4**: *Implement a feature store to centralize and reuse features across projects, ensuring consistency in feature usage.*

This action would not directly address the immediate problem of model performance. While a feature store is useful for managing features consistently across projects, it does not directly help in identifying or improving the relevance of features in your current model.
