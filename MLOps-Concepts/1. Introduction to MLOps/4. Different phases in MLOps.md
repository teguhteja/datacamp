# Different phases in MLOps

1. Different phases in MLOps
00:00 - 00:16
Great work so far! Now, let’s dive into the heart of MLOps - the machine learning lifecycle. This isn't just theory, it’s our roadmap to turning our ML projects from ideas into real-world impact.

2. MLOps lifecycle
00:16 - 00:33
Imagine the ML lifecycle as a thrilling three-act play: Design, Development, and Deployment. Each act is crucial, and the story often loops back, creating a dynamic, iterative process that keeps your projects agile and responsive.

3. Why the machine learning lifecycle?
00:33 - 00:58
Here's why mastering this lifecycle is our secret weapon: It's our blueprint for success, showing how to structure ML projects for maximum impact. It defines the key players at each stage, ensuring we have the right talent at the right time. And it's our toolkit for optimization, allowing us to apply cutting-edge practices and tools at every step.

4. Design phase
00:58 - 01:29
In the design phase, we clarify the context of the problem and assess the added value of using machine learning. Gathering clear business requirements helps us define success, while establishing key metrics allows us to track progress effectively. Additionally, ensuring high-quality data processing is essential for building a robust model. Throughout this phase, we engage stakeholders to evaluate the project's viability and make informed decisions.

5. Development phase
01:29 - 02:03
In the development phase, the real magic happens. This is where we dive deep into creating our machine learning model. We experiment with various combinations of data, algorithms, and hyperparameters, testing different approaches to find the best fit for our problem. This phase involves training multiple models, evaluating their performance, and iterating on our designs based on the results. Our goal is to emerge with a well-tuned model that not only meets the defined metrics but is also ready for deployment in a real-world setting.

6. Deployment phase
02:03 - 02:40
In the deployment phase, our model meets the real world. In this phase, we focus on integrating our model into existing business processes, ensuring it operates seamlessly within the larger system. We might build a microservice around our model, allowing for easy access and scalability. Setting up monitoring systems is crucial here, since we want to track the model’s performance, detect data drift, and receive alerts if the model's predictions begin to degrade. This ongoing monitoring ensures that our model remains effective and continues to deliver value over time.

7. MLOps lifecycle
02:40 - 03:08
Throughout this journey, we'll learn to constantly evaluate and pivot. Is the project still viable? Is it delivering value? We'll develop the skills to make these crucial calls. By mastering this lifecycle, we're not just building models, we're architecting solutions that drive business success. As we advance in this course, we will explore each phase in detail, equipping ourselves with hands-on skills and valuable insights.

8. Let's practice!
03:08 - 03:15
