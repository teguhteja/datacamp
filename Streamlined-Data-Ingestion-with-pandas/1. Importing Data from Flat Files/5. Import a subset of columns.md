# Import a subset of columns

Import a subset of columns
The Vermont tax data contains 147 columns describing household composition, income sources, and taxes paid by ZIP code and income group. Most analyses don't need all these columns. In this exercise, you will create a dataframe with fewer variables using read_csv()s usecols argument.

Let's focus on household composition to see if there are differences by geography and income level. To do this, we'll need columns on income group, ZIP code, tax return filing status (e.g., single or married), and dependents. The data uses codes for variable names, so the specific columns needed are in the instructions.

pandas has already been imported as pd.

Create a list of columns to use: zipcode, agi_stub (income group), mars1 (number of single households), MARS2 (number of households filing as married), and NUMDEP (number of dependents).
Create a dataframe from vt_tax_data_2016.csv that uses only the selected columns.

# Create list of columns to use
cols = ____

# Create dataframe from csv using only selected columns
data = ____("vt_tax_data_2016.csv", ____)

# View counts of dependents and tax returns by income level
print(data.groupby("agi_stub").sum())


Here's how to modify the code to import only the necessary columns:

```python
# Create list of columns to use
cols = ["zipcode", "agi_stub", "mars1", "MARS2", "NUMDEP"]

# Create dataframe from CSV using only selected columns
data = pd.read_csv("vt_tax_data_2016.csv", usecols=cols)

# View counts of dependents and tax returns by income level
print(data.groupby("agi_stub").sum())
```

### Explanation:
1. `cols = ["zipcode", "agi_stub", "mars1", "MARS2", "NUMDEP"]` - Specifies a list of columns you want to import from the file.
2. `pd.read_csv("vt_tax_data_2016.csv", usecols=cols)` - Loads only the specified columns into the `data` DataFrame.
3. `data.groupby("agi_stub").sum()` - Groups the data by the `agi_stub` field (income group) and calculates the sum of the selected numeric columns for each group. This way, you can analyze differences by income level.
