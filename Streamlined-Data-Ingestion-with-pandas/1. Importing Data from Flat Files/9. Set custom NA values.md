# Set custom NA values

Set custom NA values
Part of data exploration and cleaning consists of checking for missing or NA values and deciding how to account for them. This is easier when missing values are treated as their own data type. and there are pandas functions that specifically target such NA values. pandas automatically treats some values as missing, but we can pass additional NA indicators with the na_values argument. Here, you'll do this to ensure that invalid ZIP codes in the Vermont tax data are coded as NA.

pandas has been imported as pd.

Create a dictionary, null_values, specifying that 0s in the zipcode column should be considered NA values.
Load vt_tax_data_2016.csv, using the na_values argument and the dictionary to make sure invalid ZIP codes are treated as missing.

# Create dict specifying that 0s in zipcode are NA values
null_values = {____}

# Load csv using na_values keyword argument
data = pd.read_csv("vt_tax_data_2016.csv", 
                   ____)

# View rows with NA ZIP codes
print(data[data.zipcode.isna()])

Here's how to set custom NA values for loading the CSV file, treating `0` in the `zipcode` column as an NA value:

```python
# Create dict specifying that 0s in zipcode are NA values
null_values = {
    "zipcode": 0  # Treat 0s in the zipcode column as NA
}

# Load csv using na_values keyword argument
data = pd.read_csv("vt_tax_data_2016.csv", 
                   na_values=null_values)

# View rows with NA ZIP codes
print(data[data.zipcode.isna()])
```

### Explanation:
1. **Creating the Dictionary**:
   - `null_values = {"zipcode": 0}`: This dictionary specifies that any `0` values in the `zipcode` column should be treated as NA (missing) values. The key is the column name, and the value is the indicator for missing data.

2. **Loading the CSV**:
   - `pd.read_csv("vt_tax_data_2016.csv", na_values=null_values)`: This line loads the CSV file and applies the `na_values` argument. It tells pandas to convert `0` in the `zipcode` column into NA values as defined in the `null_values` dictionary.

3. **Viewing Rows with NA ZIP Codes**:
   - `print(data[data.zipcode.isna()])`: This line filters the DataFrame to show only the rows where the `zipcode` is NA, allowing you to inspect the entries that were marked as missing based on the custom NA value you specified.

Using this approach helps ensure that your data cleaning process correctly identifies and handles invalid or missing values effectively.
