# Specify data types

Specify data types
When loading a flat file, pandas infers the best data type for each column. Sometimes its guesses are off, particularly for numbers that represent groups or qualities instead of quantities.

Looking at the data dictionary for vt_tax_data_2016.csv reveals two such columns. The agi_stub column contains numbers that correspond to income categories, and zipcode has 5-digit values that should be strings -- treating them as integers means we lose leading 0s, which are meaningful. Let's specify the correct data types with the dtype argument.

pandas has been imported for you as pd.

Load vt_tax_data_2016.csv with no arguments and view the dataframe's dtypes attribute. Note the data types of zipcode and agi_stub.
# Load csv with no additional arguments
data = ____("vt_tax_data_2016.csv")

# Print the data types
print(____)

Here's how to load the CSV and view the data types:

```python
# Load csv with no additional arguments
data = pd.read_csv("vt_tax_data_2016.csv")

# Print the data types
print(data.dtypes)
```

### Explanation:
1. `pd.read_csv("vt_tax_data_2016.csv")` - Loads the data from the CSV file into a DataFrame named `data`.
2. `data.dtypes` - Prints the data types of each column in the DataFrame. This will help you understand how pandas has interpreted the types, such as whether `zipcode` and `agi_stub` are stored as integers, strings, or another type.

2
Create a dictionary, data_types, specifying that agi_stub is "category" data and zipcode is string data.
Reload the CSV with the dtype argument and the dictionary to set the correct column data types.
View the dataframe's dtypes attribute.

# Create dict specifying data types for agi_stub and zipcode
data_types = {____,
			  ____}

# Load csv using dtype to set correct data types
data = pd.read_csv("vt_tax_data_2016.csv", ____)

# Print data types of resulting frame
print(data.dtypes.head())

```py
# Create dict specifying data types for agi_stub and zipcode
data_types = {"agi_stub": "category",
			  "zipcode": str}

# Load csv using dtype to set correct data types
data = pd.read_csv("vt_tax_data_2016.csv", dtype=data_types)

# Print data types of resulting frame
print(data.dtypes.head())


```

Certainly! Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each part of the code you provided:

### 1. Creating a Dictionary for Data Types

```python
# Create dict specifying data types for agi_stub and zipcode
data_types = {
    "agi_stub": "category",
    "zipcode": str
}
```

- **Purpose**: This line creates a dictionary named `data_types` that maps specific columns in the DataFrame to their desired data types.
- **Key-Value Pairs**:
  - **"agi_stub": "category"**: This specifies that the `agi_stub` column should be treated as a categorical variable. Categorical data types are used for variables that take on a limited number of distinct values (e.g., income groups), and they are more memory-efficient than regular object types for large datasets.
  - **"zipcode": str**: This indicates that the `zipcode` column should be interpreted as a string (text). By using `str`, pandas will treat all ZIP codes as strings rather than integers, which is important because ZIP codes can start with zero (e.g., "01234") and should not be converted to a numeric type that would drop the leading zero.

### 2. Loading the CSV with Specified Data Types

```python
# Load csv using dtype to set correct data types
data = pd.read_csv("vt_tax_data_2016.csv", dtype=data_types)
```

- **Purpose**: This line reads the CSV file `vt_tax_data_2016.csv` into a pandas DataFrame named `data`.
- **Parameters**:
  - **"vt_tax_data_2016.csv"**: The file path for the CSV file to be loaded.
  - **`dtype=data_types`**: This parameter tells pandas to use the `data_types` dictionary to enforce the specified data types for the corresponding columns while loading the data. This ensures that `agi_stub` is treated as a categorical variable and `zipcode` as a string, as defined earlier.

### 3. Printing the Data Types of the DataFrame

```python
# Print data types of resulting frame
print(data.dtypes.head())
```

- **Purpose**: This line prints the data types of all columns in the DataFrame `data`.
- **`data.dtypes`**: This attribute of the DataFrame returns a Series containing the data types of each column. Each index corresponds to the column name, and the values represent the data types assigned.
- **`.head()`**: This method typically returns the first few entries of a DataFrame or Series. However, since `dtypes` is already a concise representation of column types, you could also just use `print(data.dtypes)` to view the data types for all columns without any truncation.

### Summary

Overall, this code is essential for ensuring that the data imported from the CSV file is correctly typed for analysis. Using the right data types can improve performance, allow for more efficient memory usage, and help avoid potential issues when performing data operations, especially when dealing with categorical data and strings that may have special formatting.
