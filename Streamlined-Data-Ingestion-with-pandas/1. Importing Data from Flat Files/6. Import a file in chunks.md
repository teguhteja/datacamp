# Import a file in chunks

Import a file in chunks
When working with large files, it can be easier to load and process the data in pieces. Let's practice this workflow on the Vermont tax data.

The first 500 rows have been loaded as vt_data_first500. You'll get the next 500 rows. To do this, you'll employ several keyword arguments: nrows and skiprows to get the correct records, header to tell pandas the data does not have column names, and names to supply the missing column names. You'll also want to use the list() function to get column names from vt_data_first500 to reuse.

pandas has been imported as pd.

Instructions

Use nrows and skiprows to make a dataframe, vt_data_next500, with the next 500 rows.
Set the header argument so that pandas knows there is no header row.
Name the columns in vt_data_next500 by supplying a list of vt_data_first500's columns to the names argument.

# Create dataframe of next 500 rows with labeled columns
vt_data_next500 = pd.read_csv("vt_tax_data_2016.csv", 
                       		  ____,
                       		  ____,
                       		  ____,
                       		  ____)

# View the Vermont dataframes to confirm they're different
print(vt_data_first500.head())
print(vt_data_next500.head())

Here's how to complete the code to import the next 500 rows in chunks:

```python
# Create dataframe of next 500 rows with labeled columns
vt_data_next500 = pd.read_csv("vt_tax_data_2016.csv", 
                              nrows=500,                # Read the next 500 rows
                              skiprows=500,             # Skip the first 500 rows
                              header=None,              # Indicate there is no header row in this chunk
                              names=list(vt_data_first500.columns))  # Use column names from the first dataframe

# View the Vermont dataframes to confirm they're different
print(vt_data_first500.head())
print(vt_data_next500.head())
```

### Explanation:
1. `nrows=500` - Specifies that you want to load 500 rows of data.
2. `skiprows=500` - Skips the first 500 rows, so you get rows 501 to 1000.
3. `header=None` - Tells pandas that the data does not have a header row, so it should not interpret the first row as column names.
4. `names=list(vt_data_first500.columns)` - Uses the column names from `vt_data_first500` to label the columns in `vt_data_next500`.
