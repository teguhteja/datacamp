# Get data from CSVs

Get data from CSVs
In this exercise, you'll create a dataframe from a CSV file. The United States makes available CSV files containing tax data by ZIP or postal code, allowing us to analyze income information in different parts of the country. We'll focus on a subset of the data, vt_tax_data_2016.csv, which has select tax statistics by ZIP code in Vermont in 2016.

To load the data, you'll need to import the pandas library, then read vt_tax_data_2016.csv and assign the resulting dataframe to a variable. Then we'll have a look at the data.

Instructions

Import the pandas library as pd.
Use read_csv() to load vt_tax_data_2016.csv and assign it to the variable data.
View the first few lines of the dataframe with the head() method. This code has been written for you.

# Import pandas as pd
import ____ as pd

# Read the CSV and assign it to the variable data
data = ____(____)

# View the first few lines of data
print(data.head())

Here's how you can complete the code:

```python
# Import pandas as pd
import pandas as pd

# Read the CSV and assign it to the variable data
data = pd.read_csv("vt_tax_data_2016.csv")

# View the first few lines of data
print(data.head())
```

### Explanation:
1. `import pandas as pd` - This imports the `pandas` library and assigns it the alias `pd` for easier use.
2. `pd.read_csv("vt_tax_data_2016.csv")` - This loads the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame named `data`.
3. `data.head()` - This displays the first few rows of the DataFrame, helping you get an overview of the data.
