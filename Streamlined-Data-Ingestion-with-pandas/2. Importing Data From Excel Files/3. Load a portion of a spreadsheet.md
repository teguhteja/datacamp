# Load a portion of a spreadsheet

Load a portion of a spreadsheet
Spreadsheets meant to be read by people often have multiple tables, e.g., a small business might keep an inventory workbook with tables for different product types on a single sheet. Even tabular data may have header rows of metadata, like the New Developer Survey data here. While the metadata is useful, we don't want it in a dataframe. You'll use read_excel()'s skiprows keyword to get just the data. You'll also create a string to pass to usecols to get only columns AD and AW through BA, about future job goals.

pandas has been imported as pd.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a single string, col_string, specifying that pandas should load column AD and the range AW through BA.
Load fcc_survey_headers.xlsx', setting skiprows and usecols to skip the first two rows of metadata and get only the columns in col_string.
View the selected column names in the resulting dataframe.

# Create string of lettered columns to load
col_string = ____

# Load data with skiprows and usecols set
survey_responses = ____("fcc_survey_headers.xlsx", 
                        ____, 
                        ____)

# View the names of the columns selected
print(survey_responses.columns)


Here's how you can set up the code to load the specific columns using `pandas`:

```python
# Create string of lettered columns to load
col_string = "AD,AW:BA"

# Load data with skiprows and usecols set
survey_responses = pd.read_excel("fcc_survey_headers.xlsx", 
                                 skiprows=2, 
                                 usecols=col_string)

# View the names of the columns selected
print(survey_responses.columns)
```

### Explanation:
1. `col_string`: Specifies columns "AD" and the range "AW" through "BA".
2. `read_excel`: `skiprows=2` skips the first two rows of metadata, and `usecols=col_string` loads only the specified columns.
3. `print(survey_responses.columns)`: Displays the names of the loaded columns.
