# Set Boolean columns

Set Boolean columns
Datasets may have columns that are most accurately modeled as Boolean values. However, pandas usually loads these as floats by default, since defaulting to Booleans may have undesired effects like turning NA values into Trues.

fcc_survey_subset.xlsx contains a string ID column and several True/False columns indicating financial stressors. You'll evaluate which non-ID columns have no NA values and therefore can be set as Boolean, then tell read_excel() to load them as such with the dtype argument.

pandas is loaded as pd.

Count NA values in each column of survey_data with isna() and sum(). Note which columns besides ID.x, if any, have zero NAs.
# Load the data
survey_data = pd.read_excel("fcc_survey_subset.xlsx")

# Count NA values in each column
print(survey_data.____)


To count the NA (Not Available) values in each column of the `survey_data` DataFrame, you can use the `isna()` method combined with the `sum()` function. Here’s how you can fill in the blank in your code snippet:

```python
# Load the data
survey_data = pd.read_excel("fcc_survey_subset.xlsx")

# Count NA values in each column
print(survey_data.isna().sum())
```

### Explanation:
- **`survey_data.isna()`**: This method returns a DataFrame of the same shape as `survey_data`, where each cell contains `True` if the value is NA and `False` otherwise.
- **`.sum()`**: When called on a DataFrame, this method sums up the `True` values (which are treated as 1) for each column, effectively counting the number of NA values in each column.

### Additional Step:
To note which columns (besides `ID.x`) have zero NAs, you can add a filtering step like this:

```python
# Count NA values in each column
na_counts = survey_data.isna().sum()

# Print the counts of NA values
print(na_counts)

# Check which columns besides ID.x have zero NAs
zero_na_columns = na_counts[na_counts == 0].index.tolist()
zero_na_columns.remove('ID.x')  # Remove 'ID.x' if it exists in the list
print("Columns with zero NAs (besides ID.x):", zero_na_columns)
```

### Summary:
1. **Count NA Values**: The code counts the number of NA values in each column of `survey_data`.
2. **Identify Columns with Zero NAs**: It filters to identify which columns have zero NA values, excluding `ID.x` from the result. This is useful for understanding the completeness of your data.

Set read_excel()'s dtype argument to load the HasDebt column as Boolean data.
Supply the Boolean column name to the print statement to view financial burdens by group.
# Set dtype to load appropriate column(s) as Boolean data
survey_data = pd.read_excel("fcc_survey_subset.xlsx",
                            ____)

# View financial burdens by Boolean group
print(survey_data.groupby(____).sum())

To load the `HasDebt` column as Boolean data when using `pd.read_excel()`, you can set the `dtype` argument. Here’s how to fill in the blanks in your code:

### Completed Code:
```python
# Set dtype to load appropriate column(s) as Boolean data
survey_data = pd.read_excel("fcc_survey_subset.xlsx",
                            dtype={"HasDebt": bool})  # Specify HasDebt column as Boolean

# View financial burdens by Boolean group
print(survey_data.groupby("HasDebt").sum())  # Group by HasDebt and sum the results
```

### Explanation:
1. **Setting the `dtype` Argument**:
   - The `dtype` argument in `pd.read_excel()` allows you to specify the data type for specific columns as they are read into the DataFrame.
   - Here, `dtype={"HasDebt": bool}` indicates that the `HasDebt` column should be treated as a Boolean type. This is useful for ensuring that True/False values are correctly interpreted.

2. **Grouping by `HasDebt`**:
   - The `groupby("HasDebt")` method groups the DataFrame by the `HasDebt` column, which will contain `True` for those who have debt and `False` for those who do not.
   - The `sum()` function then calculates the sum of numeric columns within each group, allowing you to analyze financial burdens by whether individuals have debt.

### Summary:
- This code snippet effectively loads the data from an Excel file while ensuring that the `HasDebt` column is treated as a Boolean type.
- It then groups the data based on whether individuals have debt and calculates the sum of numeric financial burden columns, providing insights into financial status based on debt.
