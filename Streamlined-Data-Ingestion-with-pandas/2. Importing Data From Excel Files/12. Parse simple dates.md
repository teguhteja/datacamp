# Parse simple dates

Parse simple dates
pandas does not infer that columns contain datetime data; it interprets them as object or string data unless told otherwise. Correctly modeling datetimes is easy when they are in a standard format -- we can use the parse_dates argument to tell read_excel() to read columns as datetime data.

The New Developer Survey responses contain some columns with easy-to-parse timestamps. In this exercise, you'll make sure they're the right data type.

pandas has been loaded as pd.

Instructions

Load fcc_survey.xlsx, making sure that the Part1StartTime column is parsed as datetime data.
View the first few values of the survey_data.Part1StartTime to make sure it contains datetimes.

# Load file, with Part1StartTime parsed as datetime data
survey_data = pd.read_excel("fcc_survey.xlsx",
                            ____)

# Print first few values of Part1StartTime
print(survey_data.Part1StartTime.____)

To ensure that the `Part1StartTime` column in the Excel file `fcc_survey.xlsx` is parsed as datetime data, you can use the `parse_dates` argument in the `pd.read_excel()` function. Hereâ€™s how to fill in the blanks in your code snippet:

### Completed Code:
```python
# Load file, with Part1StartTime parsed as datetime data
survey_data = pd.read_excel("fcc_survey.xlsx",
                            parse_dates=["Part1StartTime"])  # Specify the column to parse as datetime

# Print first few values of Part1StartTime
print(survey_data.Part1StartTime.head())  # Use head() to view the first few entries
```

### Explanation:
1. **Using the `parse_dates` Argument**:
   - The `parse_dates` argument allows you to specify which columns should be interpreted as datetime data. By passing `["Part1StartTime"]`, you indicate that this column contains timestamps that need to be parsed.

2. **Loading the Data**:
   - The `pd.read_excel()` function reads the Excel file and processes the specified column as datetime data, converting any recognizable date format into Python's `datetime` type.

3. **Viewing the Data**:
   - The `print(survey_data.Part1StartTime.head())` statement outputs the first five rows of the `Part1StartTime` column, allowing you to verify that the data has been correctly parsed as datetime objects.

### Summary:
- This code snippet effectively loads survey data from an Excel file while ensuring that the `Part1StartTime` column is correctly interpreted as datetime data.
- By using the `parse_dates` argument, you facilitate better handling of temporal data for subsequent analysis and operations, such as filtering and time series analysis.
