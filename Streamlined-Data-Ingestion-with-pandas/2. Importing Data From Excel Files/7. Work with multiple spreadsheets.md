# Work with multiple spreadsheets

Work with multiple spreadsheets
Workbooks meant primarily for human readers, not machines, may store data about a single subject across multiple sheets. For example, a file may have a different sheet of transactions for each region or year in which a business operated.

The FreeCodeCamp New Developer Survey file is set up similarly, with samples of responses from different years in different sheets. Your task here is to compile them in one dataframe for analysis.

pandas has been imported as pd. All sheets have been read into the ordered dictionary responses, where sheet names are keys and dataframes are values, so you can get dataframes with the values() method.

Create an empty dataframe, all_responses.
Set up a for loop to iterate through the values in the responses dictionary.
Concatenate each dataframe to all_responses and reassign the result to the same variable name.

# Create an empty dataframe
all_responses = ____

# Set up for loop to iterate through values in responses
for df in ____:
  # Print the number of rows being added
  print("Adding {} rows".format(df.shape[0]))
  # Concatenate all_responses and df, assign result
  all_responses = pd.concat(____)

# Graph employment statuses in sample
counts = all_responses.groupby("EmploymentStatus").EmploymentStatus.count()
counts.plot.barh()
plt.show()

```py
# Create an empty dataframe
all_responses = pd.DataFrame()

# Set up for loop to iterate through values in responses
for df in responses.values():
  # Print the number of rows being added
  print("Adding {} rows".format(df.shape[0]))
  # Concatenate all_responses and df, assign result
  all_responses = pd.concat([all_responses, df])

# Graph employment statuses in sample
counts = all_responses.groupby("EmploymentStatus").EmploymentStatus.count()
counts.plot.barh()
plt.show()

```

Sure! Let’s break down the provided code snippet step by step to understand its purpose and functionality in compiling data from multiple DataFrames and visualizing the results.

### Code Breakdown

```python
# Create an empty dataframe
all_responses = pd.DataFrame()
```
1. **Creating an Empty DataFrame**:
   - Here, `all_responses` is initialized as an empty DataFrame using `pd.DataFrame()`.
   - This DataFrame will be used to accumulate data from multiple sources (in this case, multiple sheets of an Excel file).

```python
# Set up for loop to iterate through values in responses
for df in responses.values():
```
2. **Looping Through DataFrames**:
   - `responses` is presumably a dictionary containing multiple DataFrames, with each DataFrame corresponding to a different sheet or dataset.
   - The `values()` method retrieves all the DataFrames from the `responses` dictionary.
   - The `for` loop iterates through each DataFrame (referred to as `df`) in the dictionary.

```python
  # Print the number of rows being added
  print("Adding {} rows".format(df.shape[0]))
```
3. **Displaying Row Count**:
   - The `shape[0]` property of the DataFrame `df` returns the number of rows it contains.
   - This line prints a message indicating how many rows are being added from the current DataFrame, which helps in tracking the size of the data being compiled.

```python
  # Concatenate all_responses and df, assign result
  all_responses = pd.concat([all_responses, df])
```
4. **Concatenating DataFrames**:
   - `pd.concat()` is used to combine the existing `all_responses` DataFrame with the current DataFrame (`df`).
   - The result of this concatenation is reassigned back to `all_responses`.
   - **Note**: It’s typically a good practice to include `ignore_index=True` to reset the index after concatenation, but it’s omitted here. Without it, the indices from `all_responses` and `df` will be retained, which could lead to duplicate indices if the DataFrames have overlapping rows.

```python
# Graph employment statuses in sample
counts = all_responses.groupby("EmploymentStatus").EmploymentStatus.count()
```
5. **Grouping and Counting Employment Statuses**:
   - The code groups the combined DataFrame (`all_responses`) by the `EmploymentStatus` column using the `groupby()` method.
   - The `.count()` method then counts the number of occurrences of each unique employment status in the DataFrame, resulting in a Series (`counts`) that reflects how many respondents fall into each employment status category.

```python
counts.plot.barh()
plt.show()
```
6. **Visualizing the Data**:
   - `counts.plot.barh()` creates a horizontal bar plot of the counts of employment statuses. 
   - This visualization provides a clear and immediate view of the distribution of employment statuses among the survey respondents.
   - `plt.show()` is called to display the plot on the screen.

### Summary
This code effectively performs the following tasks:
- Initializes an empty DataFrame for data accumulation.
- Iterates through multiple DataFrames retrieved from a dictionary.
- Concatenates these DataFrames into a single DataFrame while tracking the number of rows added.
- Groups the combined data by employment status and counts occurrences.
- Finally, it visualizes the results with a horizontal bar chart, making it easier to interpret the data at a glance.

This is a common workflow in data analysis when dealing with multiple sources of structured data, such as survey results spread across different sheets in an Excel file.
