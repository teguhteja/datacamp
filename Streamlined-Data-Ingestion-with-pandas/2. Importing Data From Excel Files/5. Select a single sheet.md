# Select a single sheet

Select a single sheet
An Excel workbook may contain multiple sheets of related data. The New Developer Survey response workbook has sheets for different years. Because read_excel() loads only the first sheet by default, you've already gotten survey responses for 2016. Now, you'll create a dataframe of 2017 responses using read_excel()'s sheet_name argument in a couple different ways.

pandas has been imported as pd.

Create a dataframe from the second workbook sheet by passing the sheet's position to sheet_name.
# Create df from second worksheet by referencing its position
responses_2017 = pd.read_excel("fcc_survey.xlsx",
                               ____)

# Graph where people would like to get a developer job
job_prefs = responses_2017.groupby("JobPref").JobPref.count()
job_prefs.plot.barh()
plt.show()

To create a dataframe from the second workbook sheet by passing the sheet's position to `sheet_name`, you can use the following code:

```python
# Create df from second worksheet by referencing its position
responses_2017 = pd.read_excel("fcc_survey.xlsx",
                               sheet_name=1)  # sheet_name=1 refers to the second sheet

# Graph where people would like to get a developer job
job_prefs = responses_2017.groupby("JobPref").JobPref.count()
job_prefs.plot.barh()
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:
- `sheet_name=1`: Refers to the second sheet in the workbook (sheets are zero-indexed, so `0` would be the first sheet).
- The `groupby` method is used to count the number of responses for each job preference.
- `plot.barh()`: Creates a horizontal bar chart to display the job preferences. Make sure you have imported `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt` before running the plotting commands.

Create a dataframe from the 2017 sheet by providing the sheet's name to read_excel().
# Create df from second worksheet by referencing its name
responses_2017 = pd.read_excel("fcc_survey.xlsx",
                               ____)

# Graph where people would like to get a developer job
job_prefs = responses_2017.groupby("JobPref").JobPref.count()
job_prefs.plot.barh()
plt.show()

To create a dataframe from the 2017 sheet using its name, you can do the following:

```python
# Create df from second worksheet by referencing its name
responses_2017 = pd.read_excel("fcc_survey.xlsx",
                               sheet_name="2017")  # Use the actual name of the sheet

# Graph where people would like to get a developer job
job_prefs = responses_2017.groupby("JobPref").JobPref.count()
job_prefs.plot.barh()
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:
- `sheet_name="2017"`: Replace `"2017"` with the actual name of the sheet in your Excel file if it differs.
- The rest of the code groups and counts the responses for "JobPref" and then creates a horizontal bar chart. Make sure `matplotlib.pyplot` is imported as `plt`.
