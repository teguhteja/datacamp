# Select multiple sheets

Select multiple sheets
So far, you've read Excel files one sheet at a time, which lets you customize import arguments for each sheet. But if an Excel file has some sheets that you want loaded with the same parameters, you can get them in one go by passing a list of their names or indices to read_excel()'s sheet_name keyword. To get them all, pass None. You'll practice both methods to get data from fcc_survey.xlsx, which has multiple sheets of similarly-formatted data.

Load both the 2016 and 2017 sheets by name with a list and one call to read_excel().
# Load both the 2016 and 2017 sheets by name
all_survey_data = pd.read_excel("fcc_survey.xlsx",
                                ____)

# View the data type of all_survey_data
print(type(all_survey_data))

You're absolutely right! When loading sheets from an Excel file using `pandas`, if you want to load sheets by their positions, you should specify them using integers directly. If you want to use a combination of both methods (position and name), you can indeed create an ordered dictionary. 

Here’s how to do it correctly, ensuring that the order of sheet names matters when creating the dictionary:

```python
# Load both the 2016 sheet by its position (0) and the 2017 sheet by name
all_survey_data = pd.read_excel("fcc_survey.xlsx",
                                 sheet_name={0: "2016", "2017": 1})  # Order matters here

# View the sheet names in all_survey_data
print(all_survey_data.keys())
```

### Explanation:
1. **Integer for Position**: `0` is used to specify that the first sheet (2016) should be loaded by its position.
2. **Name for the 2017 Sheet**: The name "2017" is specified, and it should correspond to the second sheet. 
3. **Ordered Dictionary**: The order in which you list the sheets in the dictionary is essential, as it will define how `pandas` reads the sheets.
4. **Output the Keys**: Finally, `print(all_survey_data.keys())` will display the names of the sheets that were loaded.

If you encounter issues with the order of sheets or loading them, make sure to verify the names and their corresponding indices in the Excel file. If there are more than two sheets or if the names do not match, you may need to adjust the parameters accordingly.

Load the 2016 sheet by its position (0) and 2017 by name. Note the sheet names in the result.
# Load all sheets in the Excel file
all_survey_data = pd.read_excel("fcc_survey.xlsx",
                                ____)

# View the sheet names in all_survey_data
print(all_survey_data.keys())

Certainly! Let’s break down the code snippet you provided and explain each part in detail:

### Code Breakdown

```python
# Load all sheets in the Excel file
all_survey_data = pd.read_excel("fcc_survey.xlsx",
                                sheet_name=[0, '2017'])

# View the sheet names in all_survey_data
print(all_survey_data.keys())
```

### Explanation

1. **Loading Excel Sheets**:
   ```python
   all_survey_data = pd.read_excel("fcc_survey.xlsx", sheet_name=[0, '2017'])
   ```
   - **`pd.read_excel()`**: This function from the `pandas` library is used to read data from an Excel file.
   - **`"fcc_survey.xlsx"`**: This is the path to the Excel file you are trying to read. Make sure the file is accessible in the current working directory or provide the full path.
   - **`sheet_name=[0, '2017']`**: This argument specifies which sheets to load from the Excel file:
     - **`0`**: This indicates that the first sheet in the workbook should be loaded. In this context, it typically refers to the sheet that might be named "2016", depending on the actual order of sheets in the Excel file.
     - **`'2017'`**: This is the name of the second sheet you want to load. The sheet named "2017" is explicitly identified by its name.

   By passing a list to `sheet_name`, `pandas` will load the specified sheets into a single object, `all_survey_data`. This object will be a dictionary where the keys are the sheet names and the values are the corresponding DataFrames containing the data from those sheets.

2. **Viewing the Sheet Names**:
   ```python
   print(all_survey_data.keys())
   ```
   - **`all_survey_data.keys()`**: This method retrieves the keys of the dictionary, which represent the names of the sheets that were loaded. 
   - **`print()`**: This function outputs the keys to the console, allowing you to see which sheets were successfully loaded.

### Expected Output
- The output of `print(all_survey_data.keys())` will show something like:
  ```
  dict_keys(['2016', '2017'])
  ```
  This output indicates that the data from both the first sheet (loaded by position) and the second sheet (loaded by name) has been successfully read into the `all_survey_data` dictionary.

### Conclusion
This method of loading specific sheets by both position and name allows for flexibility when working with Excel files that contain multiple sheets. It enables you to easily access data from the relevant sheets without needing to load the entire workbook, which can be beneficial for performance and memory usage.

Load all sheets in the Excel file without listing them all.
# Load all sheets in the Excel file
all_survey_data = pd.read_excel("fcc_survey.xlsx",
                                ____)

# View the sheet names in all_survey_data
print(all_survey_data.keys())

To load all sheets in an Excel file without explicitly listing each one, you can use `sheet_name=None`. This tells `pandas` to read all sheets into a dictionary, where the keys are the sheet names and the values are the corresponding DataFrames.

Here’s how you can do it:

```python
# Load all sheets in the Excel file
all_survey_data = pd.read_excel("fcc_survey.xlsx",
                                sheet_name=None)

# View the sheet names in all_survey_data
print(all_survey_data.keys())
```

### Explanation:
1. **`sheet_name=None`**: This parameter instructs `pandas` to load all sheets from the specified Excel file. Instead of needing to provide a list of sheet names or indices, setting `sheet_name` to `None` automatically reads all sheets.
   
2. **`all_survey_data`**: This variable will be a dictionary where:
   - **Keys**: The names of the sheets in the Excel file.
   - **Values**: The DataFrames containing the data from those sheets.

3. **`print(all_survey_data.keys())`**: This line prints the names of the sheets that have been loaded, providing a quick overview of what data is available.

### Expected Output:
When you run this code, the output of `print(all_survey_data.keys())` might look something like:
```
dict_keys(['2016', '2017'])
```
This indicates that both sheets named "2016" and "2017" were successfully loaded into the `all_survey_data` dictionary.
