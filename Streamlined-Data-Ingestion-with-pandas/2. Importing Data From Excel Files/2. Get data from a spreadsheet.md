# Get data from a spreadsheet

Get data from a spreadsheet
In this exercise, you'll create a dataframe from a "base case" Excel file: one with a single sheet of tabular data. The fcc_survey.xlsx file here has a sample of responses from FreeCodeCamp's annual New Developer Survey. This survey asks participants about their demographics, education, work and home life, plus questions about how they're learning to code. Let's load all of it.

pandas has not been pre-loaded in this exercise, so you'll need to import it yourself before using read_excel() to load the spreadsheet.

Instructions
100 XP
Load the pandas library as pd.
Read in fcc_survey.xlsx and assign it to the variable survey_responses.
Print the first few records of survey_responses.

# Load pandas as pd
____

# Read spreadsheet and assign it to survey_responses
survey_responses = ____

# View the head of the dataframe
print(____)

To complete this exercise, you'll need to import the pandas library and use the read_excel() function to load the data from the Excel file. Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Load pandas as pd
import pandas as pd

# Read spreadsheet and assign it to survey_responses
survey_responses = pd.read_excel('fcc_survey.xlsx')

# View the head of the dataframe
print(survey_responses.head())
```

This code will load the data from the fcc_survey.xlsx file into a DataFrame called survey_responses and then print the first few records using the head() method. 
Make sure the fcc_survey.xlsx file is in the same directory as your script or provide the correct path to the file.
