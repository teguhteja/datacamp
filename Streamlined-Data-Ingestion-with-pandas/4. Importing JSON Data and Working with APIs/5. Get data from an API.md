# Get data from an API

Get data from an API
In this exercise, you'll use requests.get() to query the Yelp Business Search API for cafes in New York City. requests.get() needs a URL to get data from. The Yelp API also needs search parameters and authorization headers passed to the params and headers keyword arguments, respectively.

You'll need to extract the data from the response with its json() method, and pass it to pandas's DataFrame() function to make a dataframe. Note that the necessary data is under the dictionary key "businesses".

pandas (as pd) and requests have been loaded. Authorization data is in the dictionary headers, and the needed API parameters are stored as params.

Get data about New York City cafes from the Yelp API (api_url) with requests.get(). The necessary params and headers information has been provided.
Extract the JSON data from the response with its json() method, and assign it to data.
Load the cafe listings to the dataframe cafes with pandas's DataFrame() function. The listings are under the "businesses" key in data.
Print the dataframe's dtypes to see what information you're getting.

api_url = "https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search"

# Get data about NYC cafes from the Yelp API
response = ____(____, 
                headers=headers, 
                params=params)

# Extract JSON data from the response
data = response.____

# Load data to a dataframe
cafes = ____(____)

# View the data's dtypes
print(cafes.dtypes)

To complete the task of fetching data from the Yelp Business Search API and loading it into a pandas DataFrame, you will fill in the placeholders in the provided code. Hereâ€™s the complete code with explanations for each step:

```python
import pandas as pd
import requests

# Define the API URL
api_url = "https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search"

# Get data about NYC cafes from the Yelp API
response = requests.get(api_url, headers=headers, params=params)

# Extract JSON data from the response
data = response.json()

# Load data to a dataframe
cafes = pd.DataFrame(data['businesses'])

# View the data's dtypes
print(cafes.dtypes)
```

### Explanation of Each Step:

1. **API URL Definition**:
   - The variable `api_url` stores the endpoint for the Yelp Business Search API.

2. **Fetching Data**:
   - The `requests.get()` function is used to send a GET request to the Yelp API. It takes in the API URL along with the `headers` (for authorization) and `params` (for query parameters like location and search terms).

3. **Extracting JSON Data**:
   - The response object contains the data returned by the API. The `json()` method is called on the response object to convert it into a Python dictionary. This dictionary is assigned to the variable `data`.

4. **Loading Data into a DataFrame**:
   - The DataFrame is created using `pd.DataFrame()`, with the data extracted from the 'businesses' key in the `data` dictionary. This key contains the list of cafes returned by the API.

5. **Viewing Data Types**:
   - Finally, `cafes.dtypes` displays the data types of each column in the DataFrame, helping you understand the structure and types of information you have retrieved.

### Notes:
- Ensure that the `headers` dictionary contains the necessary authorization information, such as an API key for Yelp.
- The `params` dictionary should include any relevant search parameters, such as location, category (e.g., "cafes"), and other search filters required by the Yelp API.
