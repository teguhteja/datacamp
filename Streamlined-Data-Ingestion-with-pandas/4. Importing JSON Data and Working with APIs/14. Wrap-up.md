# Wrap-up

1. Wrap-up
00:00 - 00:06
Congratulations! You reached the end of this course and covered a lot of ground.

2. Recap
00:06 - 00:24
In chapters 1 and 2, you built pipelines to data in flat files and spreadsheets, correcting common issues like incorrectly typed data in the process. You also learned some things to look out for when performing these corrections at import.

3. Recap
00:24 - 00:34
In chapter 3, you shifted focus to databases, combining SQL and Python to automate data acquisition.

4. Recap
00:34 - 00:52
Finally, in chapter 4, you learned how to load JSONs, access APIs programmatically, and flatten nested data, as well as some ways to combine datasets within pandas, opening up a slew of data acquisition options.

5. Where to next?
00:52 - 01:06
Of course, acquiring data is just the beginning. But if you need ideas on where to go next, DataCamp offers courses where you can further explore pandas' data wrangling capabilities,

6. Where to next?
01:06 - 01:10
dig into analysis topics,

7. Where to next?
01:10 - 01:12
learn visualization techniques,

8. Where to next?
01:12 - 01:18
or practice wrangling data in the context of a full data science workflow.

9. Congrats!
01:18 - 01:32
It's been fun working on this course, and I hope you now feel better equipped to create reproducible data pipelines. Congrats once again, and good luck on your future projects.
