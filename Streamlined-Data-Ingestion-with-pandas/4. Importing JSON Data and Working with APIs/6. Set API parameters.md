# Set API parameters

Set API parameters
Formatting parameters to get the data you need is an integral part of working with APIs. These parameters can be passed to the get() function's params keyword argument as a dictionary.

The Yelp API requires the location parameter be set. It also lets users supply a term to search for. You'll use these parameters to get data about cafes in NYC, then process the result to create a dataframe.

pandas (as pd) and requests have been loaded. The API endpoint is stored in the variable api_url. Authorization data is stored in the dictionary headers.

Instructions

Create a dictionary, parameters, with the term and location parameters set to search for "cafe"s in "NYC".
Query the Yelp API (api_url) with requests's get() function and the headers and params keyword arguments set. Save the result as response.
Extract the JSON data from response with the appropriate method. Save the result as data.
Load the "businesses" values in data to the dataframe cafes and print the head.

# Create dictionary to query API for cafes in NYC
parameters = {____,
          	  ____}

# Query the Yelp API with headers and params set
response = ____(____,
                ____,
                ____)

# Extract JSON data from response
data = ____

# Load "businesses" values to a dataframe and print head
cafes = ____(____)
print(cafes.head())


```py
# Create dictionary to query API for cafes in NYC
parameters = {"term": "cafe",
          	  "location": "NYC"}

# Query the Yelp API with headers and params set
response = requests.get(api_url, 
                        headers=headers, 
                        params=parameters)

# Extract JSON data from response
data = response.json()

# Load "businesses" values to a dataframe and print head
cafes = pd.DataFrame(data["businesses"])
print(cafes.head())


```

Sure! Let’s break down the code snippet you provided step by step to understand what each part does.

### Code Explanation

1. **Creating a Dictionary for API Parameters**:
   ```python
   parameters = {"term": "cafe",
                 "location": "NYC"}
   ```
   - **Purpose**: This dictionary, named `parameters`, is constructed to specify the search criteria for the Yelp API.
   - **Keys**:
     - `"term"`: This key specifies the type of business you want to search for. In this case, it’s set to `"cafe"`, meaning you're looking for cafe-related businesses.
     - `"location"`: This key specifies where to search for the cafes. Here, it’s set to `"NYC"` (New York City), indicating that the search should be restricted to this geographic area.

2. **Querying the Yelp API**:
   ```python
   response = requests.get(api_url, 
                           headers=headers, 
                           params=parameters)
   ```
   - **Purpose**: This line sends a GET request to the Yelp API to retrieve data based on the specified parameters.
   - **Components**:
     - `requests.get(...)`: This is a method from the `requests` library used to send an HTTP GET request.
     - `api_url`: This variable contains the endpoint URL for the Yelp API that handles business searches.
     - `headers`: This variable typically includes authorization details (like your API key) required by the API to verify your request.
     - `params`: The `params` argument passes the `parameters` dictionary to the API, which tells the API what data you want.

3. **Extracting JSON Data from the Response**:
   ```python
   data = response.json()
   ```
   - **Purpose**: This line extracts the JSON data returned by the Yelp API response.
   - **Functionality**:
     - `response.json()`: This method converts the response object into a Python dictionary containing the JSON data. This is useful for further processing or extracting specific information.

4. **Loading the Data into a DataFrame**:
   ```python
   cafes = pd.DataFrame(data["businesses"])
   ```
   - **Purpose**: This line creates a pandas DataFrame named `cafes` from the data retrieved from the API.
   - **Data Source**: 
     - `data["businesses"]`: This accesses the "businesses" key from the JSON data, which contains a list of cafe businesses returned by the API. The DataFrame will organize this list into a structured format with rows and columns.

5. **Displaying the First Few Rows of the DataFrame**:
   ```python
   print(cafes.head())
   ```
   - **Purpose**: This line prints the first few rows (by default, the first 5 rows) of the `cafes` DataFrame.
   - **Functionality**:
     - `cafes.head()`: The `head()` method is a convenient way to quickly inspect the top rows of the DataFrame, allowing you to verify that the data has been loaded correctly and see a snapshot of the information contained within.

### Summary

Overall, this code snippet effectively sets up a query to the Yelp API to retrieve a list of cafes in New York City. It constructs the necessary parameters, makes the API call, processes the response to extract relevant data, and organizes that data into a pandas DataFrame for easy analysis or visualization. This is a common pattern when working with APIs and data in Python.
