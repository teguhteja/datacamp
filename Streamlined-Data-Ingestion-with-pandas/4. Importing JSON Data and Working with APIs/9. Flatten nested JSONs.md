# Flatten nested JSONs

Flatten nested JSONs
A feature of JSON data is that it can be nested: an attribute's value can consist of attribute-value pairs. This nested data is more useful unpacked, or flattened, into its own dataframe columns. The pandas.io.json submodule has a function, json_normalize(), that does exactly this.

The Yelp API response data is nested. Your job is to flatten out the next level of data in the coordinates and location columns.

pandas (as pd) and requests have been imported. The results of the API call are stored as response.

Instructions
100 XP
Load the json_normalize() function from pandas' io.json submodule.
Isolate the JSON data from response and assign it to data.
Use json_normalize() to flatten and load the businesses data to a dataframe, cafes. Set the sep argument to use underscores (_), rather than periods.
Show the data head.

# Load json_normalize()
____

# Isolate the JSON data from the API response
data = ____

# Flatten business data into a dataframe, replace separator
cafes = ____(data["businesses"],
             ____)

# View data
print(cafes.head())


```py
# Load json_normalize()
from pandas.io.json import json_normalize

# Isolate the JSON data from the API response
data = response.json()

# Flatten business data into a dataframe, replace separator
cafes = json_normalize(data["businesses"],
                       sep="_")

# View data
print(cafes.head())

```

Let's break down the provided code snippet step by step to explain what each part does and how it works, focusing on the process of flattening nested JSON data from the Yelp API response.

### Code Explanation

1. **Loading `json_normalize()`**:
   ```python
   from pandas.io.json import json_normalize
   ```
   - **Purpose**: This line imports the `json_normalize` function from the `pandas` library. 
   - **Functionality**: The `json_normalize()` function is specifically designed to flatten nested JSON structures into a flat table (DataFrame). By importing it, you prepare to use it for transforming JSON data that may have nested attributes.

2. **Isolating the JSON Data from the API Response**:
   ```python
   data = response.json()
   ```
   - **Purpose**: This line extracts the JSON data from the `response` object obtained from the Yelp API call.
   - **Functionality**:
     - `response`: This variable represents the HTTP response received from an API request. It contains various details including status codes and the data itself.
     - `response.json()`: This method call converts the response body into a Python dictionary, making the data easier to work with. It allows you to access different parts of the JSON structure by using standard dictionary operations.

3. **Flattening Business Data into a DataFrame**:
   ```python
   cafes = json_normalize(data["businesses"], sep="_")
   ```
   - **Purpose**: This line uses the `json_normalize()` function to flatten the nested data within the "businesses" key of the `data` dictionary into a pandas DataFrame.
   - **Components**:
     - `data["businesses"]`: This accesses the list of business entries from the JSON data. Each entry may contain nested attributes, such as coordinates or location details, which need to be flattened.
     - `json_normalize(...)`: This function processes the list of businesses and creates a DataFrame where each nested attribute becomes a separate column. 
     - `sep="_"`: This argument specifies the separator for the column names. By using an underscore (`_`) instead of the default period (`.`), it creates more readable column names. For example, a nested attribute named `"coordinates.latitude"` will be converted to `"coordinates_latitude"`.

4. **Viewing the Data**:
   ```python
   print(cafes.head())
   ```
   - **Purpose**: This line prints the first few rows of the `cafes` DataFrame.
   - **Functionality**:
     - `cafes.head()`: The `head()` method returns the first five rows of the DataFrame, providing a quick overview of the data structure and contents. This is particularly useful for verifying that the flattening process was successful and understanding how the data is organized.

### Summary

This code snippet effectively demonstrates how to extract, flatten, and display data from a nested JSON structure returned by an API. By using `json_normalize()` from the `pandas` library, it transforms complex nested data into a flat DataFrame that is easier to analyze and manipulate. The final output, shown using `print(cafes.head())`, allows you to inspect the flattened data, ensuring that the transformation was performed correctly.
