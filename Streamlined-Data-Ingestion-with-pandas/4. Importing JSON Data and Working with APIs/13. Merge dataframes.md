# Merge dataframes

Merge dataframes
In the last exercise, you built a dataset of the top 100 cafes in New York City according to Yelp. Now, you'll combine that with demographic data to investigate which neighborhood has the most good cafes per capita.

To do this, you'll merge two datasets with the DataFrame merge() method. The first,crosswalk, is a crosswalk between ZIP codes and Public Use Micro Data Sample Areas (PUMAs), which are aggregates of census tracts and correspond roughly to NYC neighborhoods. Then, you'll merge in pop_data, which contains 2016 population estimates for each PUMA.

pandas (as pd) has been imported, as has the cafes dataframe from last exercise.

Question
Explore the cafes and crosswalk dataframes in the console. Which columns should be used as join keys?

Possible answers


location_zip_code in cafes and zcta5 in crosswalk

zipcode in both

location.zipcode in cafes and zipcode in crosswalk

location_zip_code in cafes and zipcode in crosswalk

To determine the appropriate columns to use as join keys between the `cafes` and `crosswalk` DataFrames, you need to consider the names and purposes of the relevant columns in each DataFrame. Based on the options you provided, here are explanations for each:

1. **location_zip_code in cafes and zcta5 in crosswalk**:
   - This option suggests that the `location_zip_code` from the `cafes` DataFrame should be matched with the `zcta5` column in the `crosswalk` DataFrame. If `location_zip_code` represents the ZIP code and `zcta5` corresponds to a ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) that aligns with ZIP codes, this could be a valid option.

2. **zipcode in both**:
   - If both DataFrames contain a column simply named `zipcode`, this would be an ideal choice for a join key, assuming that they both represent the same data type and the same meaning.

3. **location.zipcode in cafes and zipcode in crosswalk**:
   - This option suggests that the `zipcode` is nested within a `location` object in the `cafes` DataFrame. If that is the case, you would need to access `location.zipcode` to join with `zipcode` in the `crosswalk` DataFrame.

4. **location_zip_code in cafes and zipcode in crosswalk**:
   - This option indicates that you would join `location_zip_code` from `cafes` with `zipcode` from `crosswalk`. This could be valid if `location_zip_code` represents a ZIP code that matches the format in `zipcode` in the `crosswalk`.

### Conclusion

To choose the best option as a join key, you should inspect the DataFrames in the console and check:
- The exact names of the columns.
- The data they contain (i.e., are they formatted the same way?).
- Whether they represent the same concept (e.g., are they both ZIP codes?).

Typically, if you find that both DataFrames have a straightforward `zipcode` column that refers to ZIP codes, the second option, **`zipcode in both`**, would be the simplest and most reliable join key. If you find that one DataFrame has a more nested structure or different naming, you would select the appropriate option accordingly.

### Recommendation

If you're able to explore the DataFrames, check which column names are present and whether they match, and choose based on that exploration.

Explore the crosswalk and pop_data dataframes in the console. Which columns should be used as join keys?

Possible answers


pumaname in crosswalk and puma in pop_data

puma in both

zipcode in both

pumaname in crosswalk and geog_name in pop_data

To determine the appropriate columns to use as join keys between the `crosswalk` and `pop_data` DataFrames, we should evaluate the provided options based on the potential relationships between the datasets. Here's a breakdown of each option:

1. **pumaname in crosswalk and puma in pop_data**:
   - This option suggests joining `pumaname` from `crosswalk` with `puma` from `pop_data`. If `pumaname` represents a descriptive name associated with a Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) and `puma` represents the same or related identifier in the `pop_data`, this could be a valid option.

2. **puma in both**:
   - If both DataFrames contain a column named `puma`, this would typically be an ideal choice for a join key, provided that both columns represent the same PUMA identifiers.

3. **zipcode in both**:
   - This option suggests that both DataFrames have a `zipcode` column. If both columns represent ZIP codes and are formatted similarly, this could also serve as a good join key.

4. **pumaname in crosswalk and geog_name in pop_data**:
   - This option suggests joining `pumaname` from `crosswalk` with `geog_name` from `pop_data`. If `geog_name` refers to geographical names that correspond to the `pumaname`, this could be a valid join, but it would depend on whether these two columns represent the same underlying data.

### Recommendation

To choose the best option as a join key, you should:

1. **Inspect Column Names**: Check the names of the columns in both DataFrames.
2. **Examine Data Types**: Ensure the data types (e.g., strings, integers) are compatible for a join.
3. **Evaluate Meaning**: Consider whether the values in those columns represent the same entities.

### Conclusion

If `puma` appears in both DataFrames and denotes the same geographical areas, **`puma in both`** would likely be the most straightforward and effective choice for a join key.

If you find that `pumaname` in `crosswalk` has a direct correspondence with `puma` in `pop_data`, then **`pumaname in crosswalk and puma in pop_data`** could also be valid.

Ultimately, confirm the exact column names and their meanings in the DataFrames before making a final decision.

Use the DataFrame method to merge cafes and crosswalk on location_zip_code and zipcode, respectively. Assign the result to cafes_with_pumas.
Merge pop_data into cafes_with_pumas on their puma fields. Save the result as cafes_with_pop.
# Merge crosswalk into cafes on their zip code fields
cafes_with_pumas = cafes.____



# Merge pop_data into cafes_with_pumas on puma field
cafes_with_pop = ____

# View the data
print(cafes_with_pop.head())

To merge the `cafes` DataFrame with the `crosswalk` DataFrame on their respective ZIP code fields and then merge the resulting DataFrame with the `pop_data` DataFrame on their PUMA fields, you can complete the code snippet as follows:

### Completed Code Snippet

```python
# Merge crosswalk into cafes on their zip code fields
cafes_with_pumas = cafes.merge(crosswalk, 
                                left_on='location_zip_code', 
                                right_on='zipcode', 
                                how='inner')  # Use 'inner' join or specify as needed

# Merge pop_data into cafes_with_pumas on puma field
cafes_with_pop = cafes_with_pumas.merge(pop_data, 
                                         left_on='puma', 
                                         right_on='puma', 
                                         how='inner')  # Use 'inner' join or specify as needed

# View the data
print(cafes_with_pop.head())
```

### Explanation of Each Part:

1. **Merging `cafes` and `crosswalk`**:
   ```python
   cafes_with_pumas = cafes.merge(crosswalk, 
                                   left_on='location_zip_code', 
                                   right_on='zipcode', 
                                   how='inner')
   ```
   - **Purpose**: This line merges the `cafes` DataFrame with the `crosswalk` DataFrame.
   - **left_on='location_zip_code'**: Specifies the column in the `cafes` DataFrame to join on.
   - **right_on='zipcode'**: Specifies the corresponding column in the `crosswalk` DataFrame to join on.
   - **how='inner'**: Specifies the type of join. An inner join will return only the rows with matching keys in both DataFrames.

2. **Merging `cafes_with_pumas` and `pop_data`**:
   ```python
   cafes_with_pop = cafes_with_pumas.merge(pop_data, 
                                            left_on='puma', 
                                            right_on='puma', 
                                            how='inner')
   ```
   - This line merges the previously created DataFrame (`cafes_with_pumas`) with the `pop_data` DataFrame.
   - **left_on='puma'**: Specifies the PUMA column in `cafes_with_pumas`.
   - **right_on='puma'**: Specifies the PUMA column in `pop_data`.
   - Again, an inner join is used here.

3. **Viewing the Result**:
   ```python
   print(cafes_with_pop.head())
   ```
   - This line prints the first few rows of the resulting DataFrame, allowing you to inspect the merged data.

### Conclusion

This code snippet effectively merges the `cafes`, `crosswalk`, and `pop_data` DataFrames using the specified join keys. By doing so, it combines ZIP code and PUMA-related information into a single DataFrame, which can be useful for further analysis or insights into the cafe data in relation to demographics or geographical areas.
