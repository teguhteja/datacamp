# Handle deeply nested data

Handle deeply nested data
Last exercise, you flattened data nested down one level. Here, you'll unpack more deeply nested data.

The categories attribute in the Yelp API response contains lists of objects. To flatten this data, you'll employ json_normalize() arguments to specify the path to categories and pick other attributes to include in the dataframe. You should also change the separator to facilitate column selection and prefix the other attributes to prevent column name collisions. We'll work through this in steps.

pandas (as pd) and json_normalize() have been imported. JSON-formatted Yelp data on cafes in NYC is stored as data.

Use json_normalize() to flatten records under the businesses key in data, setting underscores (_) as separators.
# Flatten businesses records and set underscore separators
flat_cafes = ____(data["businesses"],
                  ____)

# View the data
print(flat_cafes.head())

To flatten the records under the "businesses" key in the JSON data using `json_normalize()` with underscores as separators, you can complete the code snippet as follows:

### Completed Code Snippet

```python
# Flatten businesses records and set underscore separators
flat_cafes = json_normalize(data["businesses"],
                             sep="_")

# View the data
print(flat_cafes.head())
```

### Explanation of Each Part:

1. **Flattening Businesses Records**:
   ```python
   flat_cafes = json_normalize(data["businesses"], sep="_")
   ```
   - **Purpose**: This line calls the `json_normalize()` function to flatten the nested records found under the "businesses" key in the `data` dictionary.
   - **Components**:
     - `data["businesses"]`: Accesses the list of business records from the JSON data. This list may contain various nested attributes (like `location`, `coordinates`, etc.).
     - `json_normalize(...)`: The function flattens the nested structure, transforming it into a DataFrame format.
     - `sep="_"`: This argument specifies that underscores should be used as the separator in the resulting column names. For example, if there is a nested attribute `"location.address"`, it will become `"location_address"` in the flattened DataFrame.

2. **Viewing the Data**:
   ```python
   print(flat_cafes.head())
   ```
   - **Purpose**: This line prints the first five rows of the `flat_cafes` DataFrame.
   - **Functionality**: The `head()` method is useful for quickly inspecting the structure and contents of the DataFrame, allowing you to confirm that the flattening process was successful and see how the data is organized.

### Summary

This snippet effectively demonstrates how to flatten nested JSON data specifically from the "businesses" section of the Yelp API response. By using `json_normalize()` with underscores as separators, the code ensures that the resulting DataFrame is both readable and easy to work with. The final output displays the first few records of the flattened data for quick verification.

Specify the record_path to the categories data.
# Specify record path to get categories data
flat_cafes = json_normalize(data["businesses"],
                            sep="_",
                    		____)

# View the data
print(flat_cafes.head())


To specify the `record_path` to access the categories data within the "businesses" records while using `json_normalize()`, you need to provide the appropriate path to the categories field. Since "categories" is typically a nested array within each business record, you would set the `record_path` accordingly.

### Completed Code Snippet

Here's how you would complete the code snippet:

```python
# Specify record path to get categories data
flat_cafes = json_normalize(data["businesses"],
                            sep="_",
                            record_path='categories')

# View the data
print(flat_cafes.head())
```

### Explanation of Each Part:

1. **Specifying the `record_path`**:
   ```python
   record_path='categories'
   ```
   - **Purpose**: This argument tells `json_normalize()` where to look for the nested array of categories within each business record.
   - **Functionality**: By specifying `record_path='categories'`, the function will extract the information contained within the "categories" field of each business entry. If each business has multiple categories, this will flatten those into separate rows for each category associated with the business.

2. **Flattening the Data**:
   - The entire line:
     ```python
     flat_cafes = json_normalize(data["businesses"],
                                 sep="_",
                                 record_path='categories')
     ```
   - Combines accessing the businesses data and flattening the nested categories while ensuring that the resulting DataFrame has clear column names with underscores as separators.

3. **Viewing the Data**:
   ```python
   print(flat_cafes.head())
   ```
   - This remains unchanged and serves to display the first few rows of the newly created `flat_cafes` DataFrame, allowing you to verify the structure and contents.

### Important Note

However, if you want to include both the business details and their associated categories in a single DataFrame (and not just the categories), you would typically structure it slightly differently. If `categories` is an array and you want to maintain the relationship between businesses and their categories, you may not need `record_path` on its own. Instead, you could flatten the entire business structure, which would include categories as part of each business record.

### Alternative Approach

If the goal is to include both business information and categories in a flattened structure, you might do something like this:

```python
# Flatten businesses records and include categories
flat_cafes = json_normalize(data["businesses"],
                            sep="_")

# Expand categories into separate columns, if necessary
flat_cafes['categories'] = flat_cafes['categories'].apply(lambda x: [d['title'] for d in x] if isinstance(x, list) else [])
flat_cafes = flat_cafes.explode('categories')

# View the data
print(flat_cafes.head())
```

In this approach, after flattening the businesses, it processes the categories to ensure they are displayed properly, keeping the relationships intact while allowing for categories to be treated as individual entries.

Set the meta keyword argument to get business name, alias, rating, and the attributes nested under coordinates: latitude and longitude.
Add "biz_" as a meta_prefix to prevent duplicate column names.
# Load other business attributes and set meta prefix
flat_cafes = json_normalize(data["businesses"],
                            sep="_",
                    		record_path="categories",
                    		____=[____, 
                                  ____,  
                                  ____,
                          		  [____, ____], 
                          		  [____, ____]],
                    		____=____)

# View the data
print(flat_cafes.head())

To set the `meta` keyword argument in the `json_normalize()` function to include specific business attributes such as name, alias, rating, and the coordinates (latitude and longitude) with a prefix to prevent duplicate column names, you can complete the code snippet as follows:

### Completed Code Snippet

```python
# Load other business attributes and set meta prefix
flat_cafes = json_normalize(data["businesses"],
                            sep="_",
                            record_path="categories",
                            meta=["name", 
                                  "alias",  
                                  "rating",
                                  ["coordinates", "latitude"], 
                                  ["coordinates", "longitude"]],
                            meta_prefix="biz_")

# View the data
print(flat_cafes.head())
```

### Explanation of Each Part:

1. **Setting the `meta` Keyword Argument**:
   ```python
   meta=["name", 
         "alias",  
         "rating",
         ["coordinates", "latitude"], 
         ["coordinates", "longitude"]]
   ```
   - **Purpose**: The `meta` argument specifies which additional attributes you want to include in the resulting DataFrame, outside of the records being flattened.
   - **Components**:
     - `"name"`: The name of the business.
     - `"alias"`: The alias used by the business.
     - `"rating"`: The rating given to the business.
     - `["coordinates", "latitude"]`: Accesses the latitude value nested within the coordinates.
     - `["coordinates", "longitude"]`: Accesses the longitude value nested within the coordinates.

2. **Setting the `meta_prefix`**:
   ```python
   meta_prefix="biz_"
   ```
   - **Purpose**: The `meta_prefix` argument is used to add a specific prefix to the names of the columns specified in the `meta` argument.
   - **Functionality**: By setting `meta_prefix="biz_"`, the resulting DataFrame will have column names like `biz_name`, `biz_alias`, `biz_rating`, `biz_coordinates_latitude`, and `biz_coordinates_longitude`. This prevents any potential column name conflicts and makes it clear that these attributes are related to the business.

3. **Viewing the Data**:
   ```python
   print(flat_cafes.head())
   ```
   - This line remains unchanged and serves to print the first few rows of the `flat_cafes` DataFrame, allowing you to verify that the flattening and the inclusion of additional attributes were successful.

### Summary

This completed code snippet effectively demonstrates how to use `json_normalize()` to flatten nested JSON data while also including specific business attributes and adding a prefix to those attributes to prevent column name duplication. This approach makes the DataFrame organized and easy to understand, facilitating further data analysis or processing.
