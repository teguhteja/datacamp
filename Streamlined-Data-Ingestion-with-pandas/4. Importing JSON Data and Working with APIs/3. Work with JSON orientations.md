# Work with JSON orientations

Work with JSON orientations
JSON isn't a tabular format, so pandas makes assumptions about its orientation when loading data. Most JSON data you encounter will be in orientations that pandas can automatically transform into a dataframe.

Sometimes, like in this modified version of the Department of Homeless Services Daily Report, data is oriented differently. To reduce the file size, it has been split formatted. You'll see what happens when you try to load it normally versus with the orient keyword argument. The try/except block will alert you if there are errors loading the data.

pandas has been loaded as pd.

Try loading dhs_report_reformatted.json without any keyword arguments.
try:
    # Load the JSON without keyword arguments
    df = ____
    
    # Plot total population in shelters over time
    df["date_of_census"] = pd.to_datetime(df["date_of_census"])
    df.plot(x="date_of_census", 
            y="total_individuals_in_shelter")
    plt.show()
    
except ValueError:
    print("pandas could not parse the JSON.")

To load the `dhs_report_reformatted.json` file into a DataFrame without any keyword arguments and handle any potential parsing errors, you can use the following code. This example includes the necessary imports and the plotting functionality.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

try:
    # Load the JSON without keyword arguments
    df = pd.read_json('dhs_report_reformatted.json')
    
    # Convert the date_of_census column to datetime format
    df["date_of_census"] = pd.to_datetime(df["date_of_census"])
    
    # Plot total population in shelters over time
    df.plot(x="date_of_census", 
            y="total_individuals_in_shelter", 
            title="Total Individuals in Shelter Over Time")
    plt.xlabel("Date of Census")
    plt.ylabel("Total Individuals in Shelter")
    plt.show()
    
except ValueError:
    print("pandas could not parse the JSON.")
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Importing Necessary Libraries**:
   - `import pandas as pd` and `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` are used to handle data manipulation and plotting, respectively.

2. **Loading JSON Data**:
   - `pd.read_json('dhs_report_reformatted.json')` attempts to load the JSON file directly into a DataFrame called `df` without any additional keyword arguments. If the JSON structure is valid, this will work without issues.

3. **Handling Date Conversion**:
   - `pd.to_datetime(df["date_of_census"])` converts the `date_of_census` column to a datetime format, allowing for accurate plotting along the x-axis.

4. **Plotting**:
   - `df.plot(x="date_of_census", y="total_individuals_in_shelter")` creates a line plot showing the total number of individuals in shelters over time.
   - Additional plot formatting like title, x-label, and y-label are set for better visualization.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - The `try-except` block catches any `ValueError` that may arise from attempting to load the JSON if it is not well-structured, printing a message if parsing fails.

Make sure the `dhs_report_reformatted.json` file is accessible in the current working directory, or provide the correct file path for loading. Running this code should display a plot of the total population in shelters over time, assuming the JSON is correctly formatted.

Load dhs_report_reformatted.json to a dataframe with orient specified.
try:
    # Load the JSON with orient specified
    df = pd.read_json("dhs_report_reformatted.json",
                      ____)
    
    # Plot total population in shelters over time
    df["date_of_census"] = pd.to_datetime(df["date_of_census"])
    df.plot(x="date_of_census", 
            y="total_individuals_in_shelter")
    plt.show()
    
except ValueError:
    print("pandas could not parse the JSON.")

If you received a message indicating that the expected orientation was 'split' rather than 'records', you should adjust the `orient` parameter in the `pd.read_json()` call accordingly.

Hereâ€™s how you would modify the code to specify 'split' as the orientation:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

try:
    # Load the JSON with orient specified as 'split'
    df = pd.read_json("dhs_report_reformatted.json", orient='split')
    
    # Convert the date_of_census column to datetime format
    df["date_of_census"] = pd.to_datetime(df["date_of_census"])
    
    # Plot total population in shelters over time
    df.plot(x="date_of_census", 
            y="total_individuals_in_shelter",
            title="Total Individuals in Shelter Over Time")
    plt.xlabel("Date of Census")
    plt.ylabel("Total Individuals in Shelter")
    plt.show()
    
except ValueError:
    print("pandas could not parse the JSON.")
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Orientation Adjusted**:
   - Changed the `orient` parameter in the `pd.read_json()` function to `orient='split'`, which should match the expected structure of your JSON file.

### General Note:
- The **'split'** orientation is structured such that it typically consists of three keys: `index`, `columns`, and `data`. Each of these keys provides different aspects of the DataFrame.
- Always check the specific structure of the JSON you are working with to choose the appropriate orientation for parsing it correctly. If you're unsure about the structure, you can print a sample of the JSON data before loading it.
