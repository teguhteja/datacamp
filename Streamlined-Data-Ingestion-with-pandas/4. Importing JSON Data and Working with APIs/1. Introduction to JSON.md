# Introduction to JSON

Load JSON data
Many open data portals make available JSONs datasets that are particularly easy to parse. They can be accessed directly via URL. Each object is a record, all objects have the same set of attributes, and none of the values are nested objects that themselves need to be parsed.

The New York City Department of Homeless Services Daily Report is such a dataset, containing years' worth of homeless shelter population counts. You can view it in the console before loading it to a dataframe with pandas's read_json() function.

Get a sense of the contents of dhs_daily_report.json, which are printed in the console.
Load pandas as pd.
Use read_json() to load dhs_daily_report.json to a dataframe, pop_in_shelters.
View summary statistics about pop_in_shelters with the dataframe's describe() method.

# Load pandas as pd
____

# Load the daily report to a dataframe
pop_in_shelters = ____

# View summary stats about pop_in_shelters
print(____)

To load the JSON data from the file `dhs_daily_report.json` into a DataFrame using pandas, you'll follow these steps. Below is the complete code to accomplish the task, including loading pandas and viewing summary statistics of the resulting DataFrame:

```python
# Load pandas as pd
import pandas as pd

# Load the daily report to a dataframe
pop_in_shelters = pd.read_json('dhs_daily_report.json')

# View summary stats about pop_in_shelters
print(pop_in_shelters.describe())
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Importing pandas**: 
   - `import pandas as pd` allows you to use pandas functionality with the alias `pd`.

2. **Loading the JSON file**: 
   - `pd.read_json('dhs_daily_report.json')` reads the JSON file and converts it into a pandas DataFrame called `pop_in_shelters`. This function assumes that the JSON structure is flat, which means that each object in the JSON is a record, and the keys of the objects correspond to the column names.

3. **Viewing summary statistics**:
   - `print(pop_in_shelters.describe())` generates summary statistics for the DataFrame. The `describe()` method provides a quick overview of the numerical columns, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles.

Make sure that the `dhs_daily_report.json` file is accessible in the current working directory or provide the correct path to the file. Running this code will give you a DataFrame with the homeless shelter population counts and a summary of the data contained within it.
