# Getting distinct values

Getting distinct values
Sometimes an analysis doesn't need every record, but rather unique values in one or more columns. Duplicate values can be removed after loading data into a dataframe, but it can also be done at import with SQL's DISTINCT keyword.

Since hpd311calls contains data about housing issues, we would expect most records to have a borough listed. Let's test this assumption by querying unique complaint_type/borough combinations.

pandas has been imported as pd, and the database engine has been created as engine.

Note: The SQL checker is quite picky about column positions and expects fields to be selected in the specified order.

Instructions

Create a query that gets DISTINCT values for borough and complaint_type (in that order) from hpd311calls.
Use read_sql() to load the results of the query to a dataframe, issues_and_boros.
Print the dataframe to check if the assumption that all issues besides literature requests appear with boroughs listed.

# Create query for unique combinations of borough and complaint_type
query = """
SELECT ____ ____, 
       ____
  ____ hpd311calls;
"""

# Load results of query to a dataframe
issues_and_boros = ____

# Check assumption about issues and boroughs
print(____)

To retrieve distinct values for `borough` and `complaint_type` from the `hpd311calls` table and load the results into a DataFrame, you can complete the code as follows:

### Code
```python
# Create query for unique combinations of borough and complaint_type
query = """
SELECT DISTINCT borough, 
       complaint_type
  FROM hpd311calls;
"""

# Load results of query to a dataframe
issues_and_boros = pd.read_sql(query, con=engine)

# Check assumption about issues and boroughs
print(issues_and_boros)
```

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query Creation**:
   - The query uses `SELECT DISTINCT` to fetch unique combinations of the `borough` and `complaint_type` columns from the `hpd311calls` table.
   - The columns are selected in the order specified: first `borough`, then `complaint_type`.

2. **Executing the Query**:
   - `issues_and_boros = pd.read_sql(query, con=engine)` executes the SQL query and stores the result in a DataFrame named `issues_and_boros`.

3. **Printing the Results**:
   - `print(issues_and_boros)` displays the DataFrame, allowing you to check whether all complaint types, except for literature requests, are associated with boroughs.

This code snippet will help you confirm whether your assumption holds true regarding the relationship between complaint types and boroughs in the dataset.
