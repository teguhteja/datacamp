# Joining tables

Joining tables
Tables in relational databases usually have key columns of unique record identifiers. This lets us build pipelines that combine tables using SQL's JOIN operation, instead of having to combine data after importing it.

The records in hpd311calls often concern issues, like leaks or heating problems, that are exacerbated by weather conditions. In this exercise, you'll join weather data to call records along their common date columns to get everything in one dataframe. You can assume these columns have the same data type.

pandas is loaded as pd, and the database engine, engine, has been created.

Note: The SQL checker is picky about join table order -- it expects specific tables on the left and the right.

Instructions
100 XP
Complete the query to join weather to hpd311calls by their date and created_date columns, respectively.
Query the database and assign the resulting dataframe to calls_with_weather.
Print the first few rows of calls_with_weather to confirm all columns were joined.

# Query to join weather to call records by date columns
query = """
SELECT * 
  FROM hpd311calls
  JOIN ____ 
  ON hpd311calls.____ = ____.____;
"""

# Create dataframe of joined tables
calls_with_weather = ____

# View the dataframe to make sure all columns were joined
____

To complete the SQL query that joins the `weather` table with the `hpd311calls` table using their respective date columns, you can fill in the blanks as follows:

```sql
# Query to join weather to call records by date columns
query = """
SELECT * 
  FROM hpd311calls
  JOIN weather 
  ON hpd311calls.created_date = weather.date;
"""

# Create dataframe of joined tables
calls_with_weather = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

# View the dataframe to make sure all columns were joined
print(calls_with_weather.head())
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **JOIN Operation**:
   - The `JOIN` clause combines records from the `hpd311calls` and `weather` tables. The `ON` clause specifies the condition for the join, which in this case is that the `created_date` from the `hpd311calls` table matches the `date` from the `weather` table.

2. **Query Structure**:
   - The `SELECT *` statement indicates that you want to retrieve all columns from both tables in the resulting dataset.

3. **Creating the DataFrame**:
   - The `pd.read_sql(query, engine)` function executes the SQL query against the database and loads the results into the `calls_with_weather` DataFrame.

4. **Viewing the Results**:
   - `print(calls_with_weather.head())` displays the first few rows of the joined DataFrame to confirm that the columns from both tables have been successfully combined.

### Resulting DataFrame
After running this code, `calls_with_weather` will contain all columns from both the `hpd311calls` and `weather` tables, where each record corresponds to a call related to weather conditions on the same date. This provides a comprehensive dataset for further analysis of how weather impacts housing issues reported in the `hpd311calls` records.
