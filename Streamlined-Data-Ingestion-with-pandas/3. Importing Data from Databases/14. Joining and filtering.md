# Joining and filtering

Joining and filtering
Just as you might not always want all the data in a single table, you might not want all columns and rows that result from a JOIN. In this exercise, you'll use SQL to refine a data import.

Weather exacerbates some housing problems more than others. Your task is to focus on water leak reports in hpd311calls and assemble a dataset that includes the day's precipitation levels from weather to see if there is any relationship between the two. The provided SQL gets all columns in hpd311calls, but you'll need to modify it to get the necessary weather column and filter rows with a WHERE clause.

pandas is loaded as pd, and the database engine, engine, has been created.

Complete query to get the prcp column in weather and join weather to hpd311calls on their date and created_date columns, respectively.
Use read_sql() to load the results of the query into the leak_calls dataframe.
# Query to get hpd311calls and precipitation values
query = """
SELECT hpd311calls.*, ____
  FROM hpd311calls
  ____ weather
  ____ hpd311calls.____ = ____;"""

# Load query results into the leak_calls dataframe
leak_calls = ____

# View the dataframe
print(leak_calls.head())

To complete the SQL query to join the `weather` table with the `hpd311calls` table and include the `prcp` (precipitation) column, you can fill in the blanks as follows:

```sql
# Query to get hpd311calls and precipitation values
query = """
SELECT hpd311calls.*, weather.prcp
  FROM hpd311calls
  JOIN weather
  ON hpd311calls.created_date = weather.date;
"""

# Load query results into the leak_calls dataframe
leak_calls = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

# View the dataframe
print(leak_calls.head())
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **SELECT Statement**:
   - `SELECT hpd311calls.*, weather.prcp`: This line selects all columns from the `hpd311calls` table and specifically the `prcp` column from the `weather` table.

2. **JOIN Operation**:
   - `FROM hpd311calls JOIN weather`: This part of the query specifies that you want to join the `hpd311calls` table with the `weather` table.
   - `ON hpd311calls.created_date = weather.date`: This condition indicates that the joining should occur where the `created_date` column from the `hpd311calls` table matches the `date` column from the `weather` table.

3. **Loading Data into DataFrame**:
   - `leak_calls = pd.read_sql(query, engine)`: This line executes the SQL query and loads the result into the `leak_calls` DataFrame.

4. **Viewing the Result**:
   - `print(leak_calls.head())`: This command prints the first few rows of the `leak_calls` DataFrame to confirm that it contains the expected data, including information on leaks and the corresponding precipitation values.

### Resulting DataFrame
After executing this code, the `leak_calls` DataFrame will include all relevant columns from `hpd311calls` along with the precipitation data from the `weather` table, providing insights into how precipitation may correlate with calls regarding leaks.

Modify query to get only rows that have 'WATER LEAK' as their complaint_type.
# Query to get water leak calls and daily precipitation
query = """
SELECT hpd311calls.*, weather.prcp
  FROM hpd311calls
  JOIN weather
    ON hpd311calls.created_date = weather.date
  ____ hpd311calls.____ = ____;"""

# Load query results into the leak_calls dataframe
leak_calls = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

# View the dataframe
print(leak_calls.head())

To modify the query so that it only retrieves rows where the `complaint_type` is 'WATER LEAK', you can add a `WHERE` clause to the SQL statement. Hereâ€™s how you can complete the query:

```sql
# Query to get water leak calls and daily precipitation
query = """
SELECT hpd311calls.*, weather.prcp
  FROM hpd311calls
  JOIN weather
    ON hpd311calls.created_date = weather.date
  WHERE hpd311calls.complaint_type = 'WATER LEAK';
"""

# Load query results into the leak_calls dataframe
leak_calls = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

# View the dataframe
print(leak_calls.head())
```

### Explanation of the Modifications

1. **WHERE Clause**:
   - `WHERE hpd311calls.complaint_type = 'WATER LEAK'`: This condition filters the results to include only those rows from the `hpd311calls` table where the `complaint_type` column has the value 'WATER LEAK'.

2. **Resulting DataFrame**:
   - The `leak_calls` DataFrame will now contain only the records that pertain to water leak complaints, along with their corresponding daily precipitation data from the `weather` table.

By executing this query, you will obtain a focused dataset that can be used for further analysis related specifically to water leak incidents and their association with daily precipitation levels.
