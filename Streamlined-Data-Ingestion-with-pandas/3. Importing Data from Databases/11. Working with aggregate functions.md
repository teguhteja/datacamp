# Working with aggregate functions

Working with aggregate functions
If a table contains data with higher granularity than is needed for an analysis, it can make sense to summarize the data with SQL aggregate functions before importing it. For example, if you have data of flood event counts by month but precipitation data by day, you may decide to SUM precipitation by month.

The weather table contains daily readings for four months. In this exercise, you'll practice summarizing weather by month with the MAX, MIN, and SUM functions.

pandas has been loaded as pd, and a database engine, engine, has been created.

Create a query to pass to read_sql() that will get months and the MAX value of tmax by monthfrom weather.
# Create a query to get month and max tmax by month
query = """
SELECT ____, 
       ____
  FROM ____ 
  ____ ____;"""

# Get dataframe of monthly weather stats
weather_by_month = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

# View weather stats by month
print(weather_by_month)

```sql
# Create a query to get month and max tmax by month
query = """
SELECT month, 
       MAX(tmax)
  FROM weather 
 GROUP BY month;"""

# Get dataframe of monthly weather stats
weather_by_month = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

# View weather stats by month
print(weather_by_month)

```

Sure! Let’s break down the SQL query and the corresponding Python code step by step to understand its components and functionality.

### SQL Query Breakdown
```sql
# Create a query to get month and max tmax by month
query = """
SELECT month, 
       MAX(tmax)
  FROM weather 
 GROUP BY month;"""
```

1. **SELECT Clause**:
   - `SELECT month`: This indicates that we want to retrieve the `month` column from the results. However, to ensure this query runs correctly, `month` should be defined beforehand (e.g., it could be derived from a date column using a function like `strftime` or extracted in a different way). 
   - `MAX(tmax)`: This part of the query calculates the maximum value of the `tmax` column (representing daily maximum temperatures). The result will be labeled as the maximum temperature for each unique month.

2. **FROM Clause**:
   - `FROM weather`: This specifies that the data is being selected from the `weather` table.

3. **GROUP BY Clause**:
   - `GROUP BY month`: This clause groups the results by the `month` column. It ensures that for each distinct month value in the dataset, the query will compute the maximum `tmax`. Thus, if there are multiple entries for a month, it aggregates them to provide a single maximum temperature for that month.

### Python Code Breakdown
```python
# Get dataframe of monthly weather stats
weather_by_month = pd.read_sql(query, engine)
```
- **`pd.read_sql(query, engine)`**: This function from the pandas library executes the SQL query against the specified database engine (`engine`). It retrieves the results and loads them into a pandas DataFrame called `weather_by_month`. This DataFrame will contain two columns: the month and the corresponding maximum temperature for that month.

### Displaying the Results
```python
# View weather stats by month
print(weather_by_month)
```
- **`print(weather_by_month)`**: This line prints the DataFrame `weather_by_month` to the console, allowing the user to see the maximum temperatures for each month. The output would typically show two columns: one for the month and another for the highest temperature recorded in that month.

### Summary
This query efficiently summarizes weather data by:
- Retrieving distinct months and their corresponding maximum daily temperatures from the `weather` table.
- Using SQL’s aggregate functions (in this case, `MAX`) to reduce detailed daily data to monthly summaries.
- Grouping the results by month to ensure that each month’s maximum temperature is correctly computed.

### Important Note
For the SQL query to work as intended, the `month` should be defined correctly within the database. If the `month` is derived from a date field, it should be explicitly formatted in the SQL query (for example, using `strftime('%Y-%m', date) AS month`), or otherwise, it would need to be created or extracted from an existing date column in the `weather` table. Without this definition, the query might result in an error or unexpected results.

Modify the query to also get the MIN tmin value for each month.
```sql
# Create a query to get month, max tmax, and min tmin by month
query = """
SELECT month, 
       MAX(tmax), 
       MIN(tmin)
  FROM weather 
 GROUP BY month;
"""

# Get dataframe of monthly weather stats
weather_by_month = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

# View weather stats by month
print(weather_by_month)
```
Certainly! Let’s break down the SQL query and the accompanying Python code step by step to understand how it works.

### SQL Query Breakdown

```sql
# Create a query to get month, max tmax, and min tmin by month
query = """
SELECT month, 
       MAX(tmax), 
       MIN(tmin)
  FROM weather 
 GROUP BY month;
"""
```

1. **SELECT Clause**:
   - `SELECT month`: This specifies that we want to retrieve the `month` column from the `weather` table. This column represents the months in which the weather data was collected.
   - `MAX(tmax)`: This function calculates the maximum temperature (`tmax`) for each month. `tmax` represents the daily high temperatures recorded in the dataset.
   - `MIN(tmin)`: Similarly, this function calculates the minimum temperature (`tmin`) for each month. `tmin` represents the daily low temperatures recorded.

2. **FROM Clause**:
   - `FROM weather`: This indicates that we are querying data from the `weather` table, which contains daily weather readings, including temperature and precipitation data.

3. **GROUP BY Clause**:
   - `GROUP BY month`: This clause groups the result set by the `month` column. As a result, the query will return one row for each distinct month found in the `weather` table. The `MAX` and `MIN` functions will then operate on the records corresponding to each month, producing the highest and lowest temperatures for that month.

### Python Code Breakdown

```python
# Get dataframe of monthly weather stats
weather_by_month = pd.read_sql(query, engine)
```

- **pd.read_sql()**: This function from the `pandas` library executes the SQL query on the connected database (`engine` is the database engine created previously). It retrieves the result set from the SQL query and loads it directly into a pandas DataFrame called `weather_by_month`.

### Printing the Results

```python
# View weather stats by month
print(weather_by_month)
```

- This line prints the contents of the `weather_by_month` DataFrame, displaying the results of the query. The DataFrame will contain three columns:
  - **month**: The unique months present in the dataset.
  - **MAX(tmax)**: The maximum temperature recorded in that month.
  - **MIN(tmin)**: The minimum temperature recorded in that month.

### Summary
In summary, this code retrieves aggregated weather statistics from the `weather` table, specifically the maximum and minimum temperatures for each month. The use of `GROUP BY` allows the query to summarize the data effectively, producing a concise view of monthly weather patterns. The results can then be further analyzed or visualized as needed.

3
Modify the query to also get the total precipitation (prcp) for each month.
# Create query to get temperature and precipitation by month
query = """
SELECT month, 
        MAX(tmax), 
        MIN(tmin),
        ____
  FROM weather 
 GROUP BY month;
"""

# Get dataframe of monthly weather stats
weather_by_month = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

# View weather stats by month
print(weather_by_month)

To modify the SQL query to include the total precipitation for each month, you can use the `SUM()` function on the `prcp` column, which represents precipitation amounts. Here’s how the updated query will look:

```sql
# Create query to get temperature and precipitation by month
query = """
SELECT month, 
       MAX(tmax), 
       MIN(tmin),
       SUM(prcp)
  FROM weather 
 GROUP BY month;
"""

# Get dataframe of monthly weather stats
weather_by_month = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

# View weather stats by month
print(weather_by_month)
```

### Explanation of the Modifications

1. **SUM(prcp)**:
   - This function computes the total precipitation for each month by summing up all values in the `prcp` column for records that belong to the same month.

2. **Overall Query Structure**:
   - The `SELECT` statement now retrieves four columns:
     - `month`: The month being analyzed.
     - `MAX(tmax)`: The maximum temperature recorded for that month.
     - `MIN(tmin)`: The minimum temperature recorded for that month.
     - `SUM(prcp)`: The total precipitation recorded for that month.

3. **GROUP BY Clause**:
   - The query continues to group results by `month`, ensuring that all calculations (`MAX`, `MIN`, and `SUM`) are performed for each distinct month.

### Resulting DataFrame
When you execute this query and load the results into the `weather_by_month` DataFrame, it will contain:
- **month**: Each distinct month in the dataset.
- **MAX(tmax)**: The highest daily temperature recorded in that month.
- **MIN(tmin)**: The lowest daily temperature recorded in that month.
- **SUM(prcp)**: The total amount of precipitation for that month.

This allows for a comprehensive overview of weather conditions, combining temperature extremes and total precipitation into a single DataFrame for further analysis or visualization.
