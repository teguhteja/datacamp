# Filtering on multiple conditions

Filtering on multiple conditions
So far, you've selectively imported records that met a single condition, but it's also common to filter datasets on multiple criteria. In this exercise, you'll do just that.

The weather table contains daily high and low temperatures and precipitation amounts for New York City. Let's focus on inclement weather, where there was either an inch or more of snow or the high was at or below freezing (32° Fahrenheit). To do this, you'll need to build a query that uses the OR operator to look at values in both columns.

pandas is loaded as pd, and a database engine, engine, has been created.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a query that selects records in weather where tmax is less than or equal to 32 degrees OR snow is greater than or equal to 1 inch.
Use read_sql() to query the database and assign the result to the variable wintry_days.
View summary statistics with the describe() method to make sure all records in the dataframe meet the given criteria.

# Create query for records with max temps <= 32 or snow >= 1
query = """
SELECT *
  FROM weather
  ____ ____
  ____ ____;
"""

# Query database and assign result to wintry_days
wintry_days = pd.read_sql(____)

# View summary stats about the temperatures
print(____)

To create a SQL query that filters records based on multiple conditions from the `weather` table, you can complete the code as follows:

### Code
```python
# Create query for records with max temps <= 32 or snow >= 1
query = """
SELECT *
  FROM weather
  WHERE tmax <= 32 OR snow >= 1;
"""

# Query database and assign result to wintry_days
wintry_days = pd.read_sql(query, con=engine)

# View summary stats about the temperatures
print(wintry_days.describe())
```

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query Creation**:
   - The query selects all columns from the `weather` table.
   - The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records:
     - `tmax <= 32` checks for daily maximum temperatures that are less than or equal to 32°F (freezing point).
     - `OR snow >= 1` checks for days when snowfall is equal to or greater than 1 inch.
   - The `OR` operator allows the query to return records that meet either of the specified conditions.

2. **Executing the Query**:
   - `wintry_days = pd.read_sql(query, con=engine)` runs the SQL query against the database and stores the result in a DataFrame named `wintry_days`.

3. **Viewing Summary Statistics**:
   - `print(wintry_days.describe())` provides summary statistics for the numeric columns in the `wintry_days` DataFrame, allowing you to verify that the records meet the specified criteria.

This code will result in a DataFrame containing records of days that either had maximum temperatures at or below freezing or received significant snowfall, and the summary statistics will help you analyze the resulting data set.
