# Counting in groups

Counting in groups
In previous exercises, you pulled data from tables, then summarized the resulting dataframes in pandas to create graphs. By using COUNT and GROUP BY in a SQL query, we can pull those summary figures from the database directly.

The hpd311calls table has a column, complaint_type, that categorizes call records by issue, such as heating or plumbing. In order to graph call volumes by issue, you'll write a SQL query that COUNTs records by complaint type.

pandas has been imported as pd, and the database engine for data.db has been created as engine.

Create a SQL query that gets the complaint_type column and counts of all records from hpd311calls, grouped by complaint_type.
Create a dataframe with read_sql() of call counts by issue, calls_by_issue.
Run the last section of code to graph the number of calls for each housing issue.

# Create query to get call counts by complaint_type
query = """
____ ____, 
     ____(*)
  FROM hpd311calls
  ____ ____;
"""

# Create dataframe of call counts by issue
calls_by_issue = pd.read_sql(____, ____)

# Graph the number of calls for each housing issue
calls_by_issue.plot.barh(x="complaint_type")
plt.show()

To create a SQL query that counts records by `complaint_type` from the `hpd311calls` table and to load the results into a DataFrame, you can complete the code as follows:

### Code
```python
# Create query to get call counts by complaint_type
query = """
SELECT complaint_type, 
       COUNT(*)
  FROM hpd311calls
  GROUP BY complaint_type;
"""

# Create dataframe of call counts by issue
calls_by_issue = pd.read_sql(query, con=engine)

# Graph the number of calls for each housing issue
calls_by_issue.plot.barh(x="complaint_type")
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query Creation**:
   - The query uses `SELECT complaint_type` to retrieve the complaint types.
   - `COUNT(*)` counts the number of records for each complaint type.
   - `GROUP BY complaint_type` groups the results by each unique complaint type, allowing you to see how many calls correspond to each issue.

2. **Executing the Query**:
   - `calls_by_issue = pd.read_sql(query, con=engine)` executes the SQL query and stores the resulting counts in a DataFrame named `calls_by_issue`.

3. **Graphing the Results**:
   - `calls_by_issue.plot.barh(x="complaint_type")` creates a horizontal bar graph of the call counts for each housing issue, using the `complaint_type` column for the x-axis labels.
   - `plt.show()` displays the graph.

This code snippet efficiently summarizes the call volumes by issue directly from the database, allowing for a quick visualization of the data.
