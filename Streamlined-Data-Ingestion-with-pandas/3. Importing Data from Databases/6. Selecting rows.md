# Selecting rows

Selecting rows
SQL WHERE clauses return records whose values meet the given criteria. Passing such a query to read_sql() results in a dataframe loaded with only records we are interested in, so there is less filtering to do later on.

The hpd311calls table in data.db has data on calls about various housing issues, from maintenance problems to information requests. In this exercise, you'll use SQL to focus on calls about safety.

pandas has been loaded as pd, and a database engine, engine, has been created for data.db.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a query that selects all columns of records in hpd311calls that have 'SAFETY' as their complaint_type.
Use read_sql() to query the database and assign the result to the variable safety_calls.
Run the last section of code to create a graph of safety call counts in each borough.

# Create query to get hpd311calls records about safety
query = """
____ *
____ hpd311calls
____ ____;
"""

# Query the database and assign result to safety_calls
safety_calls = ____

# Graph the number of safety calls by borough
call_counts = safety_calls.groupby('borough').unique_key.count()
call_counts.plot.barh()
plt.show()

To create a SQL query that selects records about safety complaints from the `hpd311calls` table and then load that data into a DataFrame using `read_sql()`, you can complete the code as follows:

### Code
```python
# Create query to get hpd311calls records about safety
query = """
SELECT *
FROM hpd311calls
WHERE complaint_type = 'SAFETY';
"""

# Query the database and assign result to safety_calls
safety_calls = pd.read_sql(query, con=engine)

# Graph the number of safety calls by borough
call_counts = safety_calls.groupby('borough').unique_key.count()
call_counts.plot.barh()
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:
1. **SQL Query Creation**:
   - The query is defined using triple quotes for multi-line strings.
   - `SELECT *` selects all columns from the table.
   - `FROM hpd311calls` specifies the source table.
   - `WHERE complaint_type = 'SAFETY'` filters the results to only include records where the `complaint_type` is 'SAFETY'.

2. **Executing the Query**:
   - `safety_calls = pd.read_sql(query, con=engine)` executes the SQL query and loads the results into a Pandas DataFrame named `safety_calls`.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - The code groups the data by `borough` and counts the unique keys (which represent individual calls) to get the number of safety calls for each borough.
   - `call_counts.plot.barh()` creates a horizontal bar plot to visualize the count of safety calls by borough.
   - `plt.show()` displays the plot.

This code will provide you with a DataFrame containing only the safety-related calls from the `hpd311calls` table and generate a bar chart illustrating the distribution of these calls across different boroughs.
