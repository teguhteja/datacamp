# Selecting columns with SQL

Selecting columns with SQL
Datasets can contain columns that are not required for an analysis, like the weather table in data.db does. Some, such as elevation, are redundant, since all observations occurred at the same place, while others contain variables we are not interested in. After making a database engine, you'll write a query to SELECT only the date and temperature columns, and pass both to read_sql() to make a dataframe of high and low temperature readings.

pandas has been loaded as pd, and create_engine() has been imported from sqlalchemy.

Note: The SQL checker is quite picky about column positions and expects fields to be selected in the specified order.

Create a database engine for data.db.
Write a SQL query that SELECTs the date, tmax, and tmin columns from the weather table.
Make a dataframe by passing the query and engine to read_sql() and assign the resulting dataframe to temperatures.

# Create database engine for data.db
engine = ____

# Write query to get date, tmax, and tmin from weather
query = """
SELECT ____, 
       ____, 
       ____
  FROM ____;
"""

# Make a dataframe by passing query and engine to read_sql()
temperatures = ____

# View the resulting dataframe
print(temperatures)

To create a database engine and write a SQL query that selects specific columns from the `weather` table, you can complete the code as follows:

### Code
```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create database engine for data.db
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///data.db')

# Write query to get date, tmax, and tmin from weather
query = """
SELECT date, 
       tmax, 
       tmin
  FROM weather;
"""

# Make a dataframe by passing query and engine to read_sql()
temperatures = pd.read_sql(query, con=engine)

# View the resulting dataframe
print(temperatures)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Creating the Database Engine**: 
   - `engine = create_engine('sqlite:///data.db')` creates a connection to the SQLite database named `data.db`.
   
2. **Writing the SQL Query**: 
   - The query uses `SELECT` to specify the columns to retrieve: `date`, `tmax`, and `tmin`. This means the resulting DataFrame will only include these three columns.
   - The `FROM weather;` part specifies that the data is being pulled from the `weather` table.

3. **Loading Data into a DataFrame**: 
   - `temperatures = pd.read_sql(query, con=engine)` executes the SQL query and stores the results in a Pandas DataFrame called `temperatures`.

4. **Displaying the DataFrame**: 
   - `print(temperatures)` outputs the DataFrame to the console, allowing you to see the selected date and temperature readings.

This code will yield a DataFrame containing only the specified columns from the `weather` table in the SQLite database.
