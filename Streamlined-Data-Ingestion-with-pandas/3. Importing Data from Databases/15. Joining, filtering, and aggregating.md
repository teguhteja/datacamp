# Joining, filtering, and aggregating

Joining, filtering, and aggregating
In this exercise, you'll use what you've learned to assemble a dataset to investigate how the number of heating complaints to New York City's 311 line varies with temperature.

In addition to the hpd311calls table, data.db has a weather table with daily high and low temperature readings for NYC. We want to get each day's count of heat/hot water calls with temperatures joined in. This can be done in one query, which we'll build in parts.

In part one, we'll get just the data we want from hpd311calls. Then, in part two, we'll modify the query to join in weather data.

pandas has been imported as pd, and the database engine has been created as engine.

Complete the query to get created_date and counts of records whose complaint_type is HEAT/HOT WATER from hpd311calls by date.
Create a dataframe,df, containing the results of the query.
# Query to get heat/hot water call counts by created_date
query = """
SELECT hpd311calls.____, 
       ____
  FROM hpd311calls 
  ____ hpd311calls.____ = ____
  ____ hpd311calls.____;
"""

# Query database and save results as df
df = ____

# View first 5 records
print(df.head())

To complete the query for getting the `created_date` and counts of records with `complaint_type` as 'HEAT/HOT WATER', you will need to use the `COUNT()` function and group the results by `created_date`. Here's how you can fill in the blanks:

```sql
# Query to get heat/hot water call counts by created_date
query = """
SELECT hpd311calls.created_date, 
       COUNT(*)
  FROM hpd311calls 
  WHERE hpd311calls.complaint_type = 'HEAT/HOT WATER'
  GROUP BY hpd311calls.created_date;
"""

# Query database and save results as df
df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

# View first 5 records
print(df.head())
```

### Explanation of the Query Components

1. **SELECT Statement**:
   - `hpd311calls.created_date`: This selects the `created_date` from the `hpd311calls` table.
   - `COUNT(*)`: This counts the number of records for each `created_date` that meet the specified condition.

2. **FROM Clause**:
   - `FROM hpd311calls`: This specifies that the data is coming from the `hpd311calls` table.

3. **WHERE Clause**:
   - `WHERE hpd311calls.complaint_type = 'HEAT/HOT WATER'`: This filters the records to include only those where the `complaint_type` is 'HEAT/HOT WATER'.

4. **GROUP BY Clause**:
   - `GROUP BY hpd311calls.created_date`: This groups the results by the `created_date`, allowing the `COUNT(*)` function to calculate the number of records for each unique date.

5. **Creating the DataFrame**:
   - `df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)`: This executes the SQL query and stores the results in the DataFrame `df`.

After executing this query, `df` will contain the counts of heat/hot water complaint records grouped by the date they were created, and you can check the first five records using `print(df.head())`.

Modify the query to join tmax and tmin from the weather table. (There is only one record per date in weather, so we do not need SQL's MAX and MIN functions here.) Join the tables on created_date in hpd311calls and date in weather.
# Modify query to join tmax and tmin from weather by date
query = """
SELECT hpd311calls.created_date, 
	   COUNT(*), 
       weather.____,
       weather.____
  FROM hpd311calls 
       ____
       ____ hpd311calls.____ = ____
 WHERE hpd311calls.complaint_type = 'HEAT/HOT WATER' 
 GROUP BY hpd311calls.created_date;
 """

# Query database and save results as df
df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

# View first 5 records
print(df.head())

To modify the query to join the `tmax` and `tmin` columns from the `weather` table with the `hpd311calls` table, you will need to fill in the blanks for the `SELECT` and `JOIN` clauses accordingly. Here's the complete SQL query:

```sql
# Modify query to join tmax and tmin from weather by date
query = """
SELECT hpd311calls.created_date, 
       COUNT(*), 
       weather.tmax,
       weather.tmin
  FROM hpd311calls 
       JOIN weather
       ON hpd311calls.created_date = weather.date
 WHERE hpd311calls.complaint_type = 'HEAT/HOT WATER' 
 GROUP BY hpd311calls.created_date;
 """

# Query database and save results as df
df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

# View first 5 records
print(df.head())
```

### Explanation of the Modifications:

1. **SELECT Clause**:
   - `weather.tmax`: This selects the maximum temperature from the `weather` table.
   - `weather.tmin`: This selects the minimum temperature from the `weather` table.
   
2. **FROM Clause**:
   - The `FROM` clause remains the same as it still references the `hpd311calls` table.

3. **JOIN Clause**:
   - `JOIN weather`: This specifies that we are joining the `weather` table.
   - `ON hpd311calls.created_date = weather.date`: This sets the condition for the join, linking records where the `created_date` from `hpd311calls` matches the `date` from `weather`.

4. **WHERE Clause**:
   - The condition to filter records by `complaint_type` remains unchanged.

5. **GROUP BY Clause**:
   - The `GROUP BY` clause continues to group the results by `created_date`.

After running this query, the resulting DataFrame `df` will include the `created_date`, the count of heat/hot water complaint records for each date, as well as the associated maximum and minimum temperatures for that date. You can verify the results with `print(df.head())`.
