# Load entire tables

Load entire tables
In the last exercise, you saw that data.db has two tables. weather has historical weather data for New York City. hpd311calls is a subset of call records made to the city's 311 help line about housing issues.

In this exercise, you'll use the read_sql() function in pandas to load both tables. read_sql() accepts a string of either a SQL query to run, or a table to load. It also needs a way to connect to the database, like the engine in the provided code.

Use read_sql() to load the hpd311calls table by name, without any SQL.
# Load libraries
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create the database engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///data.db')

# Load hpd311calls without any SQL
hpd_calls = ____(____, ____)

# View the first few rows of data
print(hpd_calls.head())

To load the `hpd311calls` table from the SQLite database without using any SQL with the `read_sql()` function, you can fill in the placeholders in your code as follows:

### Code
```python
# Load libraries
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create the database engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///data.db')

# Load hpd311calls without any SQL
hpd_calls = pd.read_sql('hpd311calls', con=engine)

# View the first few rows of data
print(hpd_calls.head())
```

### Explanation:
- **`pd.read_sql('hpd311calls', con=engine)`**: This line uses the `read_sql()` function from Pandas to load the entire `hpd311calls` table from the database. The first argument is the name of the table, and `con=engine` specifies the connection to the SQLite database established by the `create_engine()` function.
- **`print(hpd_calls.head())`**: This line prints the first few rows of the `hpd_calls` DataFrame, allowing you to inspect the data that has been loaded from the database. 

Running this code will display the initial records from the `hpd311calls` table.

Use read_sql() and a SELECT * ... SQL query to load the entire weather table.

# Create the database engine
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///data.db")

# Create a SQL query to load the entire weather table
query = """
SELECT ____ 
  FROM ____;
"""

# Load weather with the SQL query
weather = ____(____, ____)

# View the first few rows of data
print(weather.head())

To load the entire `weather` table using a SQL query with `read_sql()`, you can fill in the placeholders in your code as follows:

### Code
```python
# Create the database engine
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///data.db")

# Create a SQL query to load the entire weather table
query = """
SELECT * 
  FROM weather;
"""

# Load weather with the SQL query
weather = pd.read_sql(query, con=engine)

# View the first few rows of data
print(weather.head())
```

### Explanation:
- **`SELECT * FROM weather;`**: This SQL query selects all columns from the `weather` table. The `*` wildcard means "all columns."
- **`pd.read_sql(query, con=engine)`**: This line executes the SQL query using the connection defined by `engine` and loads the results into a Pandas DataFrame named `weather`.
- **`print(weather.head())`**: This line prints the first few rows of the `weather` DataFrame, allowing you to see the data that has been loaded from the `weather` table.

Running this code will retrieve all records from the `weather` table in the database and display the initial rows.
