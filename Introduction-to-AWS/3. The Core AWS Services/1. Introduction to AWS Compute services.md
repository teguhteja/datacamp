# Introduction to AWS Compute services

1. Introduction to AWS Compute services
00:00 - 00:15
Hello! In this chapter, we will explore some of the core services AWS has to offer it's customers. In this video, we are going to cover AWS compute services and introduce the concept of serverless computing. Let's get started.

2. Why do we need compute services?
00:15 - 00:35
Imagine it’s Black Friday, and your website faces an overwhelming surge in traffic. Without the right infrastructure, this could lead to a disastrous crash. AWS Compute services provide the computing power needed to keep your business running smoothly during such high-demand events.

3. Compute: the backbone of digital solutions
00:35 - 00:52
Compute services provide on-demand computing power, the backbone of our digital solutions. They ensure our applications run smoothly, efficiently, and can scale based on demand, providing the horsepower behind every digital interaction.

4. Meeting the challenge with AWS
00:52 - 01:38
AWS offers two primary computing models: server-based and serverless. Server-based computing is like owning a car. It's available 24/7, offering dedicated resources and the freedom to customize. It's ideal for applications requiring specific configurations and continuous availability. Conversely, serverless computing is like hailing a taxi. It's there when you need it and gone when you don't. It's event-driven, responding to specific triggers, offering on-demand execution without continuous server management. AWS ensures you have the right tools, whether you need a dedicated server or an on-demand solution.

5. EC2 unpacked
01:38 - 02:03
Let's explore AWS' server-based solution, AWS EC2. EC2 is like a sandbox where you can build whatever you want—not just a simple box of sand, but a playground with different zones for various activities. You can choose the operating system, storage, and geographic location of your server. With EC2, it's all about customization and control.

6. Lambda unpacked
02:03 - 02:28
Lambda, on the other hand, is AWS's serverless computing platform. Named after functions from lambda calculus, it's designed to be event-driven, automatically running code in response to various events. For example, it can process a file the moment it’s uploaded or update a database when a record is added. With Lambda, it’s more about convenience than customization.

7. In real life
02:28 - 02:48
So, how do these services work in the real world? EC2 is commonly used for hosting websites or big data analytics. Lambda excels in real-time tasks like image processing or automated backups. With AWS Compute, it's all about choosing the right tool for the right job.

8. Beyond EC2 and Lambda
02:48 - 03:08
Before we conclude, let's highlight other compute services AWS offers. EC2 and Lambda are vast, but AWS also provides services for containerized applications and edge or hybrid computing. While the details of these services are beyond this course, they are available in your AWS toolbelt.

9. Let's practice!
03:08 - 03:14
Let's test your newfound knowledge of AWS compute services.
