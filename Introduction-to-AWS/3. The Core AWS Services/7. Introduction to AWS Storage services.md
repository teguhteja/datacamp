# Introduction to AWS Storage services

1. Introduction to AWS Storage services
00:00 - 00:09
Welcome! In this video, weâ€™ll explore fundamental AWS storage services, focusing on Amazon S3 and Amazon Glacier.

2. Storage vs. Databases
00:09 - 00:48
Storage plays a critical role in AWS, providing a reliable place to keep your data safe and accessible. Whether you're dealing with backups, large files, or documents, storage ensures that your data is preserved and can be retrieved when needed. This makes it essential for a wide range of tasks, from disaster recovery to archiving. Unlike databases, which are used for organizing and querying structured data, storage is designed to handle large volumes of data without the need for complex management. It's about securely storing your data and making sure it's available when you need it, on a large scale.

AWS provides a comprehensive range of storage solutions to meet different needs, whether dealing with active, frequently accessed data or long-term archival storage. Understanding these options is key to selecting the right tool for your specific use case.

4. Understanding storage types
01:05 - 02:08
We'll focus on two types of storage: direct storage and archival storage. Direct storage, like recent emails, is ideal for daily operations due to its ready accessibility. AWS S3 is an object storage service, perfect for a wide range of active data use cases, such as websites, mobile apps, content distribution, and analytics. However, S3 can become pricey with heavy usage. Archival storage, akin to old emails, is accessed infrequently but kept for future reference. AWS Glacier offers a cost-effective solution for long-term data retention, providing secure storage at lower costs for data that requires infrequent access. Choosing between S3 for active data and Glacier for archival data can significantly impact both efficiency and cost. Let's take a closer look at these storage options.

5. Diving into S3
02:08 - 02:26
S3, or Simple Storage Service, is highly scalable, durable, and secure. It caters to use cases like website hosting, data backup, and content distribution, designed to maximize benefits of scale and pass those benefits to customers.

6. Storage classes
02:26 - 03:23
Amazon S3 offers several storage classes optimized for cost, performance, and durability based on access frequency. These are: S3 Standard: Designed for frequently accessed data, offering low latency and high throughput, ideal for content distribution and dynamic websites. S3 Intelligent-Tiering: Automatically moves data between frequent and infrequent access tiers based on access patterns, optimizing storage costs. S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access): For less frequently accessed data that still requires rapid access, cost-effective for backups and disaster recovery. S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive: These are for long-term archival of rarely accessed data, offering lower costs while ensuring data security and durability.

7. Other storage services

While S3 and Glacier are prominent, AWS also offers solutions like Elastic Block Storage, Elastic File System, Shared File Storage (FSx), and Storage Gateway for other specific needs.
