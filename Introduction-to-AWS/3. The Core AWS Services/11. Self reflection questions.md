Self reflection questions
You are about to see some self-reflection questions that might seem a bit different from what you’re used to.

These questions are here to help you think about how you learned, not just what you learned. By taking a moment to reflect on what worked for you and how you can use these skills in real-world projects, you’ll get a deeper understanding of the material.

We acknowledge that at first glance, these types of questions might feel a little like busy-work. But trust us, self-reflection questions, also known as metacognitive questions, are proven to be an effective learning technique.

So take a leap of faith with us and try answering these questions earnestly. There's no need to write more than a sentence or two. Your answers are just for your own self reflection; we won't use your responses in any way.
