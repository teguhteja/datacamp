# Exploring licensing strategies

Exploring licensing strategies
Your company owns several SQL Server licenses that are still valid and have active Software Assurance. Management wants to minimize costs during the migration to AWS, especially in terms of software licensing. The IT team is also exploring the benefits of leveraging flexibility and scalability of AWS.

What is the best licensing strategy for this scenario?

Correct! The Bring Your Own License (BYOL) option allows you to maximize cost savings by reusing your existing SQL Server licenses on AWS. Since your licenses are still valid and have active Software Assurance, this approach leverages your existing investments while ensuring compliance with AWS's licensing policies. It's a cost-effective and efficient strategy for your cloud migration.
