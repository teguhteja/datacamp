In this video, we’ll dive into the fundamentals of cloud economics.

2. What is cloud economics?
00:05 - 00:36
Cloud economics refers to the financial considerations of moving to and operating in the cloud. By leveraging cloud services like AWS, organizations can significantly reduce IT expenses compared to traditional on-premises setups. This is achieved through flexible pricing models, efficient resource usage, and the elimination of many fixed costs. Let’s start by understanding the difference between fixed costs and variable costs.

3. Fixed vs variable costs
00:36 - 01:42
In traditional on-premises environments, companies face significant fixed costs, including upfront capital expenditures for hardware, data centers, and maintenance. These costs remain constant regardless of actual usage, meaning you pay for full capacity even if you’re not using it. Additionally, these costs extend beyond initial investments; they include ongoing expenses like power, cooling, security, and IT staff for maintenance and upgrades. To avoid running out of resources, businesses often over-provision, purchasing more capacity than needed. This practice frequently leads to wasted investment, further compounding the inefficiency of on-premises setups. In contrast, cloud computing, like AWS, operates on a variable cost model. You only pay for the resources you use. This pay-as-you-go approach allows businesses to scale costs directly with demand, leading to greater cost efficiency.

4. Bring Your Own Licenses (BYOL)

AWS helps you avoid these sunk costs. With AWS, you can Bring Your Own License or opt for included licenses with AWS services. For example, with Bring Your Own License, if you already have a Microsoft Windows Server or SQL Server license, you can apply that existing license to AWS infrastructure. This can be cost-effective because it allows you to leverage your current investments. Alternatively, AWS offers included licenses, where software licensing is bundled with the service, simplifying management and potentially reducing overall costs.

5. Right-sizing

Rightsizing is another crucial concept in cloud economics. Rightsizing involves adjusting the resources allocated to your workloads to match actual demand. In AWS, you can easily resize instances or storage based on usage patterns, ensuring you’re not paying for more capacity than you need. This flexibility leads to significant cost savings, especially in dynamic environments where demand fluctuates.

6. Automation

Automation also plays a key role in cost efficiency. With AWS CloudFormation, you can automate the setup and management of your cloud resources. Automation reduces the time and effort required to manage infrastructure, minimizes human error, and ensures consistent configurations. This not only saves operational costs but also allows your team to focus on higher-value tasks.

7. Managed services
03:24 - 03:58
AWS offers a wide range of managed services that provide additional cost benefits. Managed services like Amazon RDS for databases, AWS Lambda for serverless computing, and Amazon S3 for storage handle the underlying infrastructure management. This means you don’t need to worry about maintenance, patches, or scaling—AWS handles it for you. Using managed services reduces operational overhead, allowing you to focus more on your core business activities.
