# Exploring edge locations in Amazon CloudFront

Exploring edge locations in Amazon CloudFront
Understanding how to leverage AWS Regions and edge locations is essential for building resilient and high-performing applications. AWS provides various services that allow you to distribute your applications and data across different geographic areas, ensuring high availability and low latency.

In this exercise, you will explore AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon CloudFront to understand how they use multiple Regions and edge locations to achieve these goals. This knowledge is crucial for designing systems that can withstand failures and deliver content quickly to users worldwide.

Navigate to Amazon CloudFront, a global content delivery network (CDN) that accelerates the delivery of web content by caching it at strategically located edge locations around the world, reducing latency for end users.

Initiate the process of creating a global distribution from the overview page.

Locate the Price Class header, under Settings to explore the different levels of edge location coverage that you can select (no distribution will be setup in this exercise).
Think about scenarios where global coverage might be crucial despite higher costs, versus situations where regional coverage could be sufficient and more cost-effective. Reflect on the implications of choosing "Use All Edge Locations" versus a more limited selection.

Correct! This option would likely result in higher latency for users outside these regions, making it less effective for a truly global audience.
