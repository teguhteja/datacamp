# Deploying and operating in AWS

1. Deploying and operating in AWS
00:00 - 00:13
In this video, we’ll explore essential methods for deploying and operating in the AWS cloud, from provisioning resources to choosing the best deployment models and connectivity options.

2. Provisioning resources in AWS
00:13 - 00:51
When provisioning resources in AWS—allocating and configuring cloud services like servers, storage, and networking—you have multiple approaches. You can opt for one-time operations, manually setting up resources, or use automation for consistent, repeatable deployments. AWS offers tools like CloudFormation for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), allowing you to define your cloud environment in templates and automate the process, ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors—ideal for large-scale operations.

3. Accessing AWS services
00:51 - 02:08
There are several ways to access and interact with AWS services: AWS Management Console is a web-based user interface that provides a graphical way to manage and configure AWS services, suitable for those who prefer visual management. Programmatic Access which includes the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), Software Development Kits (SDKs), and APIs. These tools are ideal for automation, integrating AWS services into your workflows, and managing resources programmatically. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) means using tools like AWS CloudFormation or third-party solutions like Terraform, you can define your infrastructure as code. This approach is especially useful for automating deployments, ensuring consistency, and managing complex environments. Choosing between these options depends on your requirements. For example, if you need to automate routine tasks or integrate AWS with other tools, programmatic access or IaC might be the best fit. For one-time configurations or monitoring, the AWS Management Console could be more convenient.

4. Cloud deployment models

When deploying to the cloud—essentially moving your applications and services from local servers to the cloud environment—it’s crucial to choose the right deployment model for your needs: Public Cloud is where all resources are hosted on AWS’s infrastructure and shared with other customers. This model offers cost efficiency and scalability, making it suitable for most workloads. Private Cloud dedicates resources to a single organization. This is ideal for businesses with strict compliance or security requirements. Hybrid Cloud combines on-premises infrastructure with AWS resources. This model is useful for organizations needing to maintain certain workloads on-premises while taking advantage of cloud scalability and services. Selecting the appropriate deployment model involves evaluating your organization’s specific needs, including security, compliance, and scalability requirements.

5. Connectivity options

AWS provides several connectivity options to securely link your resources: AWS VPN is a secure, encrypted connection between your on-premises network and AWS, leveraging the public internet. This option is flexible and cost-effective for smaller workloads or temporary connections. AWS Direct Connect offers a dedicated, private network connection from your premises to AWS, providing lower latency, higher bandwidth, and more consistent performance than internet-based connections. Public Internet are resources in AWS can also be accessed directly over the public internet, suitable for public-facing applications or services that do not require private network connections.
