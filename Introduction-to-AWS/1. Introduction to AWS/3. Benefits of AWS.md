# Benefits of AWS

1. Benefits of AWS
00:00 - 00:05
In this video, we'll explore the benefits of using AWS Cloud.

2. Before the cloud...
00:05 - 00:17
Before cloud computing was introduced, businesses hosted their applications and services using on-premise solutions, relying on private data centers that they were responsible for operating and maintaining.

3. Power of the cloud
00:17 - 00:46
The cloud has revolutionized business operations by offering scalable, on-demand resources. No longer is there a need for heavy upfront investment in hardware. With AWS, you pay only for what you use, while having the flexibility to scale up or down as needed, with access to a global network of services. This flexibility and cost efficiency are key reasons why millions of customers trust AWS to run their critical applications.

4. 6 key advantages of using the cloud
00:46 - 00:51
There are six key advantages of using AWS that we'll explore further.

5. Pay for what you use
00:51 - 01:24
First, AWS operates on a consumption-based model, meaning you start small and pay only for the resources you use. Unlike on-premise solutions that require significant upfront investment in hardware, software, and infrastructure, AWS can lead to variable month-to-month costs. However, there are numerous ways to save, such as turning off unused resources, optimizing applications, and using AWS Trusted Advisor to identify cost-saving opportunities.

6. Economies of scale
01:24 - 01:36
Second, AWS benefits from economies of scale. As AWS expands its global capacity, it can offer lower pay-as-you-go costs due to its vast customer base.

7. Capacity
01:36 - 02:00
Third, AWS eliminates the guesswork of capacity planning. Traditionally, businesses had to estimate capacity, often leading to over- or under-provisioning, both of which have costly implications. With AWS, you can provision resources instantly and scale them in real-time, often within minutes, thanks to AWS's elastic nature.

8. Speed and agility
02:00 - 02:21
Speed and agility are also crucial benefits. AWS enables rapid environment setup, allowing businesses to experiment with new ideas quickly and affordably. The lower cost of failure in the cloud encourages innovation and experimentation at a faster pace than on-premise solutions.

9. Save money on datacenters
02:21 - 02:29
AWS also handles the heavy lifting of infrastructure management, allowing businesses to focus on delivering value to their customers.

10. Go global
02:29 - 02:57
Finally, AWS's global reach allows businesses to quickly deploy applications in multiple regions with just a few clicks. For example, if they're based in London and their infrastructure is hosted in Europe, but they're expanding operations to the US, you can easily replicate the architecture in a US-based region using tools like AWS CloudFormation â€” what once took weeks now takes minutes.

11. Let's practice!
02:57 - 03:06
Now that we've covered the key benefits, let's test your understanding and explore the AWS interface together.
