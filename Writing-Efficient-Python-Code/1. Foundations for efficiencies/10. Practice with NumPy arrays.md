# Practice with NumPy arrays

Practice with NumPy arrays
Let's practice slicing numpy arrays and using NumPy's broadcasting concept. Remember, broadcasting refers to a numpy array's ability to vectorize operations, so they are performed on all elements of an object at once.

A two-dimensional numpy array has been loaded into your session (called nums) and printed into the console for your convenience. numpy has been imported into your session as np.

Print the second row of nums.
Print the items of nums that are greater than six.
Create nums_dbl that doubles each number in nums.
Replace the third column in nums with a new column that adds 1 to each item in the original column.

# Print second row of nums
print(nums[____,____])

# Print all elements of nums that are greater than six
print(____[____ > ____])

# Double every element of nums
nums_dbl = ____ * ____
print(nums_dbl)

# Replace the third column of nums
nums[____,____] = ____[____,____] + ____
print(nums)

Hereâ€™s how to complete the code using NumPy to perform the specified tasks:

```python
import numpy as np

# Assume nums is a predefined 2D numpy array
# Example nums array for reference (remove this line in your actual code)
# nums = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Print second row of nums
print(nums[1, :])

# Print all elements of nums that are greater than six
print(nums[nums > 6])

# Double every element of nums
nums_dbl = nums * 2
print(nums_dbl)

# Replace the third column of nums
nums[:, 2] = nums[:, 2] + 1
print(nums)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Print the second row of `nums`**: `nums[1, :]` accesses the second row (index 1) and all columns.

2. **Print items greater than six**: `nums[nums > 6]` returns all elements of `nums` that are greater than `6`.

3. **Double every element**: `nums * 2` creates a new array `nums_dbl` where each element is doubled.

4. **Replace the third column**: `nums[:, 2] = nums[:, 2] + 1` updates the third column (index 2) by adding `1` to each element.

### Output:

- The second row will be printed.
- All elements greater than `6` will be printed.
- The doubled array will be printed.
- The modified `nums` array with the updated third column will be printed.

Question
When compared to a list object, what are two advantages of using a numpy array?

Possible answers


A numpy array is the only data structure that can be used with the numpy package and often has less verbose indexing syntax.

A numpy array contains homogeneous data types (which reduces memory consumption) and provides the ability to apply operations on all elements through broadcasting.

A numpy array supports boolean indexing and has much better one-dimensional indexing capabilities.

Both a list object and a numpy array are identical.

The correct answer is:

**A numpy array contains homogeneous data types (which reduces memory consumption) and provides the ability to apply operations on all elements through broadcasting.**

### Explanation:
1. **Homogeneous Data Types**: NumPy arrays are more memory-efficient because they store data of the same type, which allows for optimized storage and computations.

2. **Broadcasting**: NumPy arrays allow vectorized operations (broadcasting), enabling you to apply operations on all elements simultaneously without the need for explicit loops, making calculations faster and more concise.
