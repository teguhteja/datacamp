# Bringing it all together: Festivus!

Bringing it all together: Festivus!
In this exercise, you will be throwing a party—a Festivus if you will!

You have a list of guests (the names list). Each guest, for whatever reason, has decided to show up to the party in 10-minute increments. For example, Jerry shows up to Festivus 10 minutes into the party's start time, Kramer shows up 20 minutes into the party, and so on and so forth.

We want to write a few simple lines of code, using the built-ins we have covered, to welcome each of your guests and let them know how many minutes late they are to your party. Note that numpy has been imported into your session as np and the names list has been loaded as well.

Let's welcome your guests!

Use range() to create a list of arrival times (10 through 50 incremented by 10). Create the list arrival_times by unpacking the range object.

# Create a list of arrival times
arrival_times = [____(____, ____, ____)]

print(arrival_times)

Here’s how to create the `arrival_times` list using `range()`:

```python
# Create a list of arrival times
arrival_times = [*range(10, 51, 10)]

print(arrival_times)
```

### Explanation:
- **`range(10, 51, 10)`**: This generates numbers starting from `10` up to `50` (exclusive) in increments of `10`.
- **`[*range(...)]`**: The star character `*` unpacks the range object into a list, resulting in the desired list of arrival times.

### Output:
- The printed output will be: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`.

You realize your clock is three minutes fast. Convert the arrival_times list into a numpy array (called arrival_times_np) and use NumPy broadcasting to subtract three minutes from each arrival time.

# Create a list of arrival times
arrival_times = [*range(10,60,10)]

# Convert arrival_times to an array and update the times
arrival_times_np = np.____(____)
new_times = ____ - ____

print(new_times)

Here’s how to convert the `arrival_times` list into a NumPy array and adjust the arrival times by subtracting three minutes:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a list of arrival times
arrival_times = [*range(10, 60, 10)]

# Convert arrival_times to an array and update the times
arrival_times_np = np.array(arrival_times)
new_times = arrival_times_np - 3

print(new_times)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Convert to NumPy Array**: `np.array(arrival_times)` converts the list `arrival_times` into a NumPy array called `arrival_times_np`.
2. **Broadcasting**: The operation `arrival_times_np - 3` uses NumPy's broadcasting to subtract `3` from each element in the array, resulting in a new array `new_times`.

### Output:
- The printed output will show the adjusted arrival times, which will be: `[ 7, 17, 27, 37, 47]`.

Use list comprehension with enumerate() to pair each guest in the names list to their updated arrival time in the new_times array. You'll need to use the index variable created from using enumerate() on new_times to index the names list.

# Create a list of arrival times
arrival_times = [*range(10,60,10)]

# Convert arrival_times to an array and update the times
arrival_times_np = np.array(arrival_times)
new_times = arrival_times_np - 3

# Use list comprehension and enumerate to pair guests to new times
guest_arrivals = [(names[____],time) for ____,time in ____(new_times)]

print(guest_arrivals)

Here’s how to use list comprehension with `enumerate()` to pair each guest in the `names` list to their updated arrival time in the `new_times` array:

```python
import numpy as np

# Assume names is predefined
# Example names list for reference (remove this line in your actual code)
# names = ['Jerry', 'Kramer', 'Elaine', 'George', 'Newman']

# Create a list of arrival times
arrival_times = [*range(10, 60, 10)]

# Convert arrival_times to an array and update the times
arrival_times_np = np.array(arrival_times)
new_times = arrival_times_np - 3

# Use list comprehension and enumerate to pair guests to new times
guest_arrivals = [(names[i], time) for i, time in enumerate(new_times)]

print(guest_arrivals)
```

### Explanation:
1. **List Comprehension**: `[(names[i], time) for i, time in enumerate(new_times)]` creates a list of tuples. Each tuple consists of the guest's name and their corresponding arrival time.
2. **`enumerate(new_times)`**: This generates pairs of indices and values from the `new_times` array. The index `i` is used to access the corresponding name in the `names` list.

### Output:
- The printed output will be a list of tuples that pair each guest with their updated arrival time, e.g., `[('Jerry', 7), ('Kramer', 17), ('Elaine', 27), ('George', 37), ('Newman', 47)]`.

A function named welcome_guest() has been pre-loaded into your session. Use map() to apply this function to each element of the guest_arrivals list and save it as the variable welcome_map.

# Create a list of arrival times
arrival_times = [*range(10,60,10)]

# Convert arrival_times to an array and update the times
arrival_times_np = np.array(arrival_times)
new_times = arrival_times_np - 3

# Use list comprehension and enumerate to pair guests to new times
guest_arrivals = [(names[i],time) for i,time in enumerate(new_times)]

# Map the welcome_guest function to each (guest,time) pair
welcome_map = ____(____, ____)

guest_welcomes = [*welcome_map]
print(*guest_welcomes, sep='\n')

Here's how to use the `map()` function to apply the `welcome_guest()` function to each element of the `guest_arrivals` list:

```python
# Create a list of arrival times
arrival_times = [*range(10, 60, 10)]

# Convert arrival_times to an array and update the times
arrival_times_np = np.array(arrival_times)
new_times = arrival_times_np - 3

# Use list comprehension and enumerate to pair guests to new times
guest_arrivals = [(names[i], time) for i, time in enumerate(new_times)]

# Map the welcome_guest function to each (guest, time) pair
welcome_map = map(welcome_guest, guest_arrivals)

guest_welcomes = [*welcome_map]
print(*guest_welcomes, sep='\n')
```

### Explanation:
1. **`map(welcome_guest, guest_arrivals)`**: This applies the `welcome_guest` function to each tuple in the `guest_arrivals` list. Each element in `guest_arrivals` is passed to the `welcome_guest` function.
2. **Unpacking with `[*welcome_map]`**: This converts the map object to a list, allowing you to collect the results.

### Output:
- The printed output will display the welcome messages for each guest, formatted appropriately as defined in the `welcome_guest` function.
