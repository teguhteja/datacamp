A taste of things to come
In this exercise, you'll explore both the Non-Pythonic and Pythonic ways of looping over a list.

names = ['Jerry', 'Kramer', 'Elaine', 'George', 'Newman']
Suppose you wanted to collect the names in the above list that have six letters or more. In other programming languages, the typical approach is to create an index variable (i), use i to iterate over the list, and use an if statement to collect the names with six letters or more:

i = 0
new_list= []
while i < len(names):
    if len(names[i]) >= 6:
        new_list.append(names[i])
    i += 1
Let's explore some more Pythonic ways of doing this.

Print the list, new_list, that was created using a Non-Pythonic approach.

# Print the list created using the Non-Pythonic approach
i = 0
new_list= []
while i < len(names):
    if len(names[i]) >= 6:
        new_list.append(names[i])
    i += 1
print(____)

To print the list, `new_list`, replace the blank line with `new_list` itself. Here’s how the complete code would look:

```python
i = 0
new_list = []
while i < len(names):
    if len(names[i]) >= 6:
        new_list.append(names[i])
    i += 1
print(new_list)
```

This will output `new_list`, which contains names with 6 or more characters.

A more Pythonic approach would loop over the contents of names, rather than using an index variable. Print better_list.

# Print the list created by looping over the contents of names
better_list = []
for name in names:
    if len(name) >= 6:
        better_list.append(name)
print(____)

To print `better_list`, replace the blank line with `better_list` itself. Here’s the completed code:

```python
better_list = []
for name in names:
    if len(name) >= 6:
        better_list.append(name)
print(better_list)
```

This Pythonic approach directly loops over `names` and checks each `name` without using an index variable.

3
The best Pythonic way of doing this is by using list comprehension. Print best_list.

# Print the list created by using list comprehension
best_list = [name for name in names if len(name) >= 6]
print(____)

To print `best_list`, replace the blank line with `best_list` itself. Here’s the complete code:

```python
best_list = [name for name in names if len(name) >= 6]
print(best_list)
```

This list comprehension is the most Pythonic way, making the code concise and readable.
