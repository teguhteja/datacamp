# Built-in practice: enumerate()

Built-in practice: enumerate()
In this exercise, you'll practice using Python's built-in function enumerate(). This function is useful for obtaining an indexed list. For example, suppose you had a list of people that arrived at a party you are hosting. The list is ordered by arrival (Jerry was the first to arrive, followed by Kramer, etc.):

names = ['Jerry', 'Kramer', 'Elaine', 'George', 'Newman']
If you wanted to attach an index representing a person's arrival order, you could use the following for loop:

indexed_names = []
for i in range(len(names)):
    index_name = (i, names[i])
    indexed_names.append(index_name)

[(0,'Jerry'),(1,'Kramer'),(2,'Elaine'),(3,'George'),(4,'Newman')]
But, that's not the most efficient solution. Let's explore how to use enumerate() to make this more efficient.

Instead of using for i in range(len(names)), update the for loop to use i as the index variable and name as the iterator variable and use enumerate().
Rewrite the previous for loop using enumerate() and list comprehension to create a new list, indexed_names_comp.
Create another list (indexed_names_unpack) by using the star character (*) to unpack the enumerate object created from using enumerate() on names. This time, start the index for enumerate() at one instead of zero.

# Rewrite the for loop to use enumerate
indexed_names = []
for ____,_____ in ____(names):
    index_name = (i,name)
    indexed_names.append(index_name) 
print(indexed_names)

# Rewrite the above for loop using list comprehension
indexed_names_comp = [(____,____) for i,name in ____(names)]
print(indexed_names_comp)

# Unpack an enumerate object with a starting index of one
indexed_names_unpack = [____(names, ____)]
print(indexed_names_unpack)


Hereâ€™s how to complete the code using `enumerate()` and list comprehension based on the provided instructions:

```python
# Original list of names
names = ['Jerry', 'Kramer', 'Elaine', 'George', 'Newman']

# Rewrite the for loop to use enumerate
indexed_names = []
for i, name in enumerate(names):
    index_name = (i, name)
    indexed_names.append(index_name) 
print(indexed_names)

# Rewrite the above for loop using list comprehension
indexed_names_comp = [(i, name) for i, name in enumerate(names)]
print(indexed_names_comp)

# Unpack an enumerate object with a starting index of one
indexed_names_unpack = [*enumerate(names, 1)]
print(indexed_names_unpack)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Using `enumerate()` in the for loop**: This allows you to iterate over `names` while automatically providing an index (`i`).
  
2. **List comprehension with `enumerate()`**: This creates `indexed_names_comp`, which is a more concise way to achieve the same result.

3. **Unpacking with a starting index of one**: The expression `[*enumerate(names, 1)]` creates a list of tuples starting the index at `1` instead of `0`.

### Output:

- **`indexed_names`** will be `[(0, 'Jerry'), (1, 'Kramer'), (2, 'Elaine'), (3, 'George'), (4, 'Newman')]`
- **`indexed_names_comp`** will be the same as above.
- **`indexed_names_unpack`** will be `[(1, 'Jerry'), (2, 'Kramer'), (3, 'Elaine'), (4, 'George'), (5, 'Newman')]` since it starts the index at `1`.
