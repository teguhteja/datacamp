# Built-in practice: map()

Built-in practice: map()
In this exercise, you'll practice using Python's built-in map() function to apply a function to every element of an object. Let's look at a list of party guests:

names = ['Jerry', 'Kramer', 'Elaine', 'George', 'Newman']
Suppose you wanted to create a new list (called names_uppercase) that converted all the letters in each name to uppercase. you could accomplish this with the below for loop:

names_uppercase = []

for name in names:
  names_uppercase.append(name.upper())

['JERRY', 'KRAMER', 'ELAINE', 'GEORGE', 'NEWMAN']
Let's explore using the map() function to do this more efficiently in one line of code.

Use map() and the method str.upper() to convert each name in the list names to uppercase. Save this to the variable names_map.
Print the data type of names_map.
Unpack the contents of names_map into a list called names_uppercase using the star character (*).
Print names_uppercase and observe its contents.

# Use map to apply str.upper to each element in names
names_map  = ____(____, ____)

# Print the type of the names_map
print(____(____))

# Unpack names_map into a list
names_uppercase = [____]

# Print the list created above
print(____)

Here’s how to complete the code using the `map()` function to convert the names to uppercase:

```python
# List of party guests
names = ['Jerry', 'Kramer', 'Elaine', 'George', 'Newman']

# Use map to apply str.upper to each element in names
names_map = map(str.upper, names)

# Print the type of the names_map
print(type(names_map))

# Unpack names_map into a list
names_uppercase = [*names_map]

# Print the list created above
print(names_uppercase)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Using `map()`**: `map(str.upper, names)` applies the `str.upper` method to each name in the `names` list. The result is a `map` object.

2. **Printing the type**: `print(type(names_map))` will show that `names_map` is a `map` object.

3. **Unpacking into a list**: `names_uppercase = [*names_map]` converts the `map` object into a list. The star character `*` is used to unpack the contents of the `map` object.

### Output:

- The type of `names_map` will be `<class 'map'>`.
- **`names_uppercase`** will be `['JERRY', 'KRAMER', 'ELAINE', 'GEORGE', 'NEWMAN']`.
