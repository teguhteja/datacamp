# Congratulations!

1. Congratulations!
00:00 - 00:08
Congratulations on completing the course! Now, you have the necessary tools to start writing efficient Python code!

2. What you have learned
00:08 - 01:18
Over the four chapters of this course, you have learned what writing efficient code truly means, and that writing Pythonic code often yields efficient code. You've explored Python's Standard Library and practiced using built-in functions like range, enumerate, and map. You know the power of NumPy arrays and can use them for fast, efficient calculations. You're a whiz at using magic commands like %timeit and know how to profile your code with the line_profiler and memory_profiler packages. You've also applied more advanced techniques to gain efficiencies by using built-in functions like zip, built-in modules like itertools and collections, and a branch of mathematics called set theory. Finally, you explored looping patterns in Python and why they are not always the most efficient approach to solving problems. You successfully eliminated loops in your code and even learned how to efficiently iterate over pandas DataFrames.

3. Well done!
