# Run differentials with .iterrows()

Run differentials with .iterrows()
You've been hired by the San Francisco Giants as an analyst—congrats! The team's owner wants you to calculate a metric called the run differential for each season from the year 2008 to 2012. This metric is calculated by subtracting the total number of runs a team allowed in a season from the team's total number of runs scored in a season. 'RS' means runs scored and 'RA' means runs allowed.

The below function calculates this metric:

def calc_run_diff(runs_scored, runs_allowed):

    run_diff = runs_scored - runs_allowed

    return run_diff
A DataFrame has been loaded into your session as giants_df and printed into the console. Let's practice using .iterrows() to add a run differential column to this DataFrame.

1
Create an empty list called run_diffs that will be used to store the run differentials you will calculate.
# Create an empty list to store run differentials
____ = ____

To create an empty list called `run_diffs` that will be used to store run differentials, you can use the following line of code:

```python
# Create an empty list to store run differentials
run_diffs = []
```

### Explanation:
- **`run_diffs`**: This is the name of the list you're creating.
- **`[]`**: This denotes an empty list in Python. You will use this list to append run differentials as you calculate them later in your code.

Write a for loop that uses .iterrows() to loop over giants_df and collects each row's runs scored and runs allowed.
# Create an empty list to store run differentials
run_diffs = []

# Write a for loop and collect runs allowed and runs scored for each row
for ____,____ in ____.____:
    runs_scored = ____[____]
    runs_allowed = ____[____]

To write a for loop that uses `.iterrows()` to loop over `giants_df` and collects each row's runs scored and runs allowed, you can use the following code:

```python
# Create an empty list to store run differentials
run_diffs = []

# Write a for loop and collect runs allowed and runs scored for each row
for index, row in giants_df.iterrows():
    runs_scored = row['RS']  # Replace 'runs_scored' with the actual column name
    runs_allowed = row['RA']  # Replace 'runs_allowed' with the actual column name
    
    # You can then calculate the run differential and append it to the list
    run_diff = runs_scored - runs_allowed
    run_diffs.append(run_diff)
```

### Explanation:
- **`for index, row in giants_df.iterrows():`**: This iterates over each row in the DataFrame `giants_df`, where `index` is the row index and `row` contains the row data.
- **`runs_scored = row['runs_scored']`**: This extracts the runs scored from the current row. Replace `'runs_scored'` with the actual name of the column in your DataFrame that holds runs scored.
- **`runs_allowed = row['runs_allowed']`**: This extracts the runs allowed from the current row. Replace `'runs_allowed'` with the actual name of the column in your DataFrame that holds runs allowed.
- **`run_diff = runs_scored - runs_allowed`**: This calculates the run differential.
- **`run_diffs.append(run_diff)`**: This appends the calculated run differential to the `run_diffs` list.

Add a line to the for loop that uses the provided function to calculate each row's run differential.
# Create an empty list to store run differentials
run_diffs = []

# Write a for loop and collect runs allowed and runs scored for each row
for i,row in giants_df.iterrows():
    runs_scored = row['RS']
    runs_allowed = row['RA']
    
    # Use the provided function to calculate run_diff for each row
    run_diff = ____(____, ____)

To add a line to the for loop that uses a provided function to calculate each row's run differential, you can modify your code as follows. Assuming the provided function is named `calculate_run_diff`, here’s how you can integrate it:

```python
# Create an empty list to store run differentials
run_diffs = []

# Write a for loop and collect runs allowed and runs scored for each row
for i, row in giants_df.iterrows():
    runs_scored = row['RS']  # Replace 'RS' with the actual column name for runs scored
    runs_allowed = row['RA']  # Replace 'RA' with the actual column name for runs allowed
    
    # Use the provided function to calculate run_diff for each row
    run_diff = calculate_run_diff(runs_scored, runs_allowed)
    
    # Append the calculated run_diff to the list
    run_diffs.append(run_diff)
```

### Explanation:
- **`run_diff = calculate_run_diff(runs_scored, runs_allowed)`**: This line calls the provided function `calculate_run_diff` with the runs scored and runs allowed for the current row, calculating the run differential and storing it in the `run_diff` variable.
- Ensure that you replace `calculate_run_diff` with the actual name of the function you have been given, if it's different.

Add a line to the loop that appends each row's run differential to the run_diffs list.
# Create an empty list to store run differentials
run_diffs = []

# Write a for loop and collect runs allowed and runs scored for each row
for i,row in giants_df.iterrows():
    runs_scored = row['RS']
    runs_allowed = row['RA']
    
    # Use the provided function to calculate run_diff for each row
    run_diff = calc_run_diff(runs_scored, runs_allowed)
    
    # Append each run differential to the output list
    ____.____(____)

giants_df['RD'] = run_diffs
print(giants_df)

To append each row's run differential to the `run_diffs` list, you can modify your code as follows:

```python
# Create an empty list to store run differentials
run_diffs = []

# Write a for loop and collect runs allowed and runs scored for each row
for i, row in giants_df.iterrows():
    runs_scored = row['RS']
    runs_allowed = row['RA']
    
    # Use the provided function to calculate run_diff for each row
    run_diff = calc_run_diff(runs_scored, runs_allowed)
    
    # Append each run differential to the output list
    run_diffs.append(run_diff)  # Append the calculated run_diff to the run_diffs list

# Assign the run_diffs list to a new column in the DataFrame
giants_df['RD'] = run_diffs
print(giants_df)
```

### Explanation:
- **`run_diffs.append(run_diff)`**: This line appends the calculated run differential (`run_diff`) to the `run_diffs` list. Each time the loop iterates, the calculated differential for that row is added to the list.
- After the loop, you assign the list of run differentials to a new column (`'RD'`) in the `giants_df` DataFrame. This allows you to see the run differentials alongside the other data in your DataFrame.
