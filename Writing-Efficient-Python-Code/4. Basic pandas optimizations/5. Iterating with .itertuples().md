# Iterating with .itertuples()

Iterating with .itertuples()
Remember, .itertuples() returns each DataFrame row as a special data type called a namedtuple. You can look up an attribute within a namedtuple with a special syntax. Let's practice working with namedtuples.

A pandas DataFrame has been loaded into your session called rangers_df. This DataFrame contains the stats ('Team', 'League', 'Year', 'RS', 'RA', 'W', 'G', and 'Playoffs') for the Major League baseball team named the Texas Rangers (abbreviated as 'TEX').

Use .itertuples() to loop over rangers_df and print each row.
# Loop over the DataFrame and print each row
for ____ in ____.____():
  print(____)

To use `.itertuples()` for looping over `rangers_df` and printing each row, you can fill in the placeholders as follows:

```python
# Loop over the DataFrame and print each row
for row in rangers_df.itertuples():
    print(row)
```

### Explanation:
- **`for row in rangers_df.itertuples():`**: This line uses `.itertuples()` to iterate over the rows of the DataFrame. Each row is returned as a named tuple, which you can then use to access the data.
- **`print(row)`**: This prints each row as a named tuple, which will display the index and the values for each column in that row. 

This approach is efficient for iterating over DataFrames, especially if you need access to row indices and values.

Loop over rangers_df with .itertuples() and save each row's Index, Year, and Wins (W) attribute as i, year, and wins.
# Loop over the DataFrame and print each row's Index, Year and Wins (W)
for row in rangers_df.itertuples():
  i = ____
  year = ____
  wins = ____
  print(i, year, wins)

To loop over `rangers_df` using `.itertuples()` and save each row's Index, Year, and Wins (W) attributes as `i`, `year`, and `wins`, you can fill in the placeholders as follows:

```python
# Loop over the DataFrame and print each row's Index, Year, and Wins (W)
for row in rangers_df.itertuples():
    i = row.Index      # Access the Index of the row
    year = row.Year    # Access the Year attribute
    wins = row.W       # Access the Wins (W) attribute
    print(i, year, wins)
```

### Explanation:
- **`for row in rangers_df.itertuples():`**: This loops through each row of the DataFrame, where `row` is a named tuple representing the data in that row.
- **`i = row.Index`**: This accesses the Index of the current row.
- **`year = row.Year`**: This accesses the Year attribute of the current row.
- **`wins = row.W`**: This accesses the Wins attribute (denoted by 'W') of the current row.
- **`print(i, year, wins)`**: This prints the collected values of `i`, `year`, and `wins` for each row.

Now, loop over rangers_df and print these values only for those rows where the Rangers made the playoffs.
# Loop over the DataFrame and print each row's Index, Year and Wins (W)
for row in rangers_df.itertuples():
  i = row.Index
  year = row.Year
  wins = row.W
  
  # Check if rangers made Playoffs (1 means yes; 0 means no)
  if ____.____ == 1:
    print(____, ____, ____)


To loop over `rangers_df` and print the Index, Year, and Wins (W) values only for the rows where the Rangers made the playoffs, you can fill in the placeholders as follows:

```python
# Loop over the DataFrame and print each row's Index, Year, and Wins (W)
for row in rangers_df.itertuples():
    i = row.Index
    year = row.Year
    wins = row.W
    
    # Check if Rangers made Playoffs (1 means yes; 0 means no)
    if row.Playoffs == 1:  # Access the Playoffs attribute
        print(i, year, wins)  # Print the Index, Year, and Wins
```

### Explanation:
- **`if row.Playoffs == 1:`**: This checks the `Playoffs` attribute of the current row. If it equals 1, it means the Rangers made the playoffs.
- **`print(i, year, wins)`**: This prints the collected values of `i`, `year`, and `wins` only for the rows where the condition is met.
