# Settle a debate with .apply()

Settle a debate with .apply()
Word has gotten to the Arizona Diamondbacks about your awesome analytics skills. They'd like for you to help settle a debate amongst the managers. One manager claims that the team has made the playoffs every year they have had a win percentage of 0.50 or greater. Another manager says this is not true.

Let's use the below function and the .apply() method to see which manager is correct.

def calc_win_perc(wins, games_played):
    win_perc = wins / games_played
    return np.round(win_perc,2)
A DataFrame named dbacks_df has been loaded into your session.

Print the first five rows of the dbacks_df DataFrame to see what the data looks like.
# Display the first five rows of the DataFrame
print(dbacks_df.____())

To print the first five rows of the `dbacks_df` DataFrame, you can use the `.head()` method. Here’s how you can complete the code:

```python
# Display the first five rows of the DataFrame
print(dbacks_df.head())
```

### Explanation:
- **`dbacks_df.head()`**: This method retrieves the first five rows of the DataFrame `dbacks_df`. If you want to see a different number of rows, you can pass an integer to the `head()` method, like `dbacks_df.head(10)` for the first ten rows.
- **`print(...)`**: This function displays the output in the console.

Running this code will show you the structure and contents of the first five rows of the `dbacks_df` DataFrame, helping you to understand the data it contains.

2
Create a pandas Series called win_percs by applying the calc_win_perc() function to each row of the DataFrame with a lambda function.
# Display the first five rows of the DataFrame
print(dbacks_df.head())

# Create a win percentage Series 
win_percs = dbacks_df.____(lambda ____: ____(row['W'], row['G']), axis=____)
print(win_percs, '\n')

To create a pandas Series called `win_percs` by applying the `calc_win_perc()` function to each row of the `dbacks_df` DataFrame using a lambda function, you can complete the code as follows:

```python
# Display the first five rows of the DataFrame
print(dbacks_df.head())

# Create a win percentage Series 
win_percs = dbacks_df.apply(lambda row: calc_win_perc(row['W'], row['G']), axis=1)
print(win_percs, '\n')
```

### Explanation:
- **`dbacks_df.apply(...)`**: This method applies a function along the specified axis of the DataFrame. In this case, you want to apply it across rows (axis=1).
- **`lambda row: calc_win_perc(row['W'], row['G'])`**: This lambda function takes each row of the DataFrame as input and calls the `calc_win_perc()` function with the values of the 'W' (wins) and 'G' (games) columns from that row.
- **`axis=1`**: This argument specifies that the function should be applied to each row.
- **`print(win_percs, '\n')`**: This will print the resulting Series containing the calculated win percentages, followed by a newline for better readability.

By running this code, you'll obtain the win percentages for each row based on the wins and games played.

Create a new column in dbacks_df called WP that contains the win percentages you calculated in the above step.
# Display the first five rows of the DataFrame
print(dbacks_df.head())

# Create a win percentage Series 
win_percs = dbacks_df.apply(lambda row: calc_win_perc(row['W'], row['G']), axis=1)
print(win_percs, '\n')

# Append a new column to dbacks_df
dbacks_df[____] = ____
print(dbacks_df, '\n')

# Display dbacks_df where WP is greater than 0.50
print(dbacks_df[dbacks_df['WP'] >= 0.50])

To create a new column in the `dbacks_df` DataFrame called `WP` that contains the win percentages calculated in the previous step, you can complete the code as follows:

```python
# Display the first five rows of the DataFrame
print(dbacks_df.head())

# Create a win percentage Series 
win_percs = dbacks_df.apply(lambda row: calc_win_perc(row['W'], row['G']), axis=1)
print(win_percs, '\n')

# Append a new column to dbacks_df
dbacks_df['WP'] = win_percs
print(dbacks_df, '\n')

# Display dbacks_df where WP is greater than 0.50
print(dbacks_df[dbacks_df['WP'] >= 0.50])
```

### Explanation:
- **`dbacks_df['WP'] = win_percs`**: This line adds a new column named `WP` to the `dbacks_df` DataFrame and assigns the calculated win percentages from the `win_percs` Series to this new column.
- **`print(dbacks_df, '\n')`**: This prints the entire DataFrame, now including the new `WP` column, followed by a newline for clarity.
- **`print(dbacks_df[dbacks_df['WP'] >= 0.50])`**: This line filters the DataFrame to display only the rows where the win percentage (`WP`) is greater than or equal to 0.50, allowing you to see which records indicate a winning team.

By running this code, you will successfully add the win percentage column to your DataFrame and filter to see only the rows with winning percentages above 50%.

Question
Which manager was correct in their claim?
Possible answers


The manager who claimed the team made the playoffs every year they've had a win percentage of 0.50 or greater.

The manager who claimed the team has not made the playoffs every year they've had a win percentage of 0.50 or greater. (X)

Both managers are crazy! The Arizona Diamondbacks have never made the playoffs.

To determine which manager's claim about the Arizona Diamondbacks is correct, you can analyze the `dbacks_df` DataFrame you have, specifically looking for the years in which the team had a win percentage of 0.50 or greater and whether they made the playoffs in those years.

### Steps to Analyze:
1. **Filter the DataFrame**: Check for entries in the `dbacks_df` where the win percentage (`WP`) is greater than or equal to 0.50.
2. **Check Playoff Status**: Within the filtered results, check if the team made the playoffs during those years.

Here’s how you can perform this analysis using Python code:

```python
# Assuming 'Playoffs' is a column in dbacks_df indicating playoff status (1 for yes, 0 for no)
winning_years = dbacks_df[dbacks_df['WP'] >= 0.50]

# Check how many of those years resulted in playoffs
playoff_years = winning_years[winning_years['Playoffs'] == 1]

# Determine the claims
if len(playoff_years) == len(winning_years):
    print("The manager who claimed the team made the playoffs every year they've had a win percentage of 0.50 or greater is correct.")
elif len(playoff_years) == 0:
    print("Both managers are crazy! The Arizona Diamondbacks have never made the playoffs.")
else:
    print("The manager who claimed the team has not made the playoffs every year they've had a win percentage of 0.50 or greater is correct.")
```

### Conclusion:
- If all winning years (0.50 or greater) resulted in playoff appearances, the first manager is correct.
- If none of the winning years resulted in playoffs, then the third option about both managers being wrong is correct.
- If some but not all winning years led to playoffs, then the second manager is correct.

After running this code, you will find out which manager's claim is accurate based on the `dbacks_df` DataFrame data.
