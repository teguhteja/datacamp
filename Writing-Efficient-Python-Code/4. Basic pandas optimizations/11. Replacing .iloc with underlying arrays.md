# Replacing .iloc with underlying arrays

Replacing .iloc with underlying arrays
Now that you have a better grasp on a DataFrame's internals let's update one of your previous analyses to leverage a DataFrame's underlying arrays. You'll revisit the win percentage calculations you performed row by row with the .iloc method:

def calc_win_perc(wins, games_played):
    win_perc = wins / games_played
    return np.round(win_perc,2)

win_percs_list = []

for i in range(len(baseball_df)):
    row = baseball_df.iloc[i]

    wins = row['W']
    games_played = row['G']

    win_perc = calc_win_perc(wins, games_played)

    win_percs_list.append(win_perc)

baseball_df['WP'] = win_percs_list
Let's update this analysis to use arrays instead of the .iloc method. A DataFrame (baseball_df) has been loaded into your session.

Use the right method to collect the underlying 'W' and 'G' arrays of baseball_df and pass them directly into the calc_win_perc() function. Store the result as a variable called win_percs_np.
# Use the W array and G array to calculate win percentages
win_percs_np = calc_win_perc(baseball_df[____].____, baseball_df[____].____)
To calculate the win percentages using the underlying 'W' (Wins) and 'G' (Games) arrays from the `baseball_df` DataFrame, you can directly access the data with the `.values` attribute or the `.to_numpy()` method. Here's how to do that:

```python
# Use the W array and G array to calculate win percentages
win_percs_np = calc_win_perc(baseball_df['W'].values, baseball_df['G'].values)
```

or alternatively:

```python
# Use the W array and G array to calculate win percentages
win_percs_np = calc_win_perc(baseball_df['W'].to_numpy(), baseball_df['G'].to_numpy())
```

### Explanation:
- `baseball_df['W']` selects the 'W' column from the DataFrame.
- `.values` or `.to_numpy()` retrieves the underlying NumPy array from that column.
- This allows you to pass the arrays directly into the `calc_win_perc()` function for calculations. 

Make sure that your `calc_win_perc` function is properly defined to handle these inputs.

2
Create a new column in baseball_df called 'WP' that contains the win percentages you just calculated.
# Use the W array and G array to calculate win percentages
win_percs_np = calc_win_perc(baseball_df['W'].values, baseball_df['G'].values)

# Append a new column to baseball_df that stores all win percentages
baseball_df[____] = ____

print(baseball_df.head())

To create a new column in the `baseball_df` DataFrame called 'WP' that contains the win percentages calculated in the previous step, you can simply assign `win_percs_np` to the new column. Here's how to do it:

```python
# Use the W array and G array to calculate win percentages
win_percs_np = calc_win_perc(baseball_df['W'].values, baseball_df['G'].values)

# Append a new column to baseball_df that stores all win percentages
baseball_df['WP'] = win_percs_np

print(baseball_df.head())
```

### Explanation:
- `baseball_df['WP'] = win_percs_np` assigns the calculated win percentages to a new column 'WP' in the `baseball_df` DataFrame.
- `print(baseball_df.head())` displays the first five rows of the updated DataFrame to verify the new column has been added correctly.

Question
Use timeit in cell magic mode within your IPython console to compare the runtimes between the old code block using .iloc and the new code you developed using NumPy arrays.

Don't include the code that defines the calc_win_perc() function or the print() statements or when timing.

You should include eight lines of code when timing the old code block and two lines of code when timing the new code you developed. You may need to press SHIFT+ENTER when using timeit in cell magic mode to get to a new line within your IPython console.

Which approach was the faster?

Possible answers


The original code with .iloc is much faster than using NumPy arrays

The old code block with .iloc and the new code with NumPy arrays have similar runtimes.

The NumPy array approach is faster than the .iloc approach. (X)
