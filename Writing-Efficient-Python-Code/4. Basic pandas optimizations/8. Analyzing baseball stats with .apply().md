# Analyzing baseball stats with .apply()

Analyzing baseball stats with .apply()
The Tampa Bay Rays want you to analyze their data.

They'd like the following metrics:

The sum of each column in the data
The total amount of runs scored in a year ('RS' + 'RA' for each year)
The 'Playoffs' column in text format rather than using 1's and 0's
The below function can be used to convert the 'Playoffs' column to text:

def text_playoffs(num_playoffs): 
    if num_playoffs == 1:
        return 'Yes'
    else:
        return 'No' 
Use .apply() to get these metrics. A DataFrame (rays_df) has been loaded and printed to the console. This DataFrame is indexed on the 'Year' column.

Apply sum() to each column of rays_df to collect the sum of each column. Be sure to specify the correct axis.
# Gather sum of all columns
stat_totals = ____.____(____, axis=____)
print(stat_totals)

To gather the sum of all columns in the DataFrame `rays_df`, you can use the `.sum()` method while specifying the appropriate axis. Here's how to complete the code:

```python
# Gather sum of all columns
stat_totals = rays_df.sum(axis=0)
print(stat_totals)
```

### Explanation:
- **`rays_df.sum(axis=0)`**: This applies the `sum()` function to each column (where `axis=0` indicates that the operation is applied vertically, across rows).
- **`print(stat_totals)`**: This will display the total sum of each column in the DataFrame.

### Result:
When you run the code, `stat_totals` will contain the sum of each column in `rays_df`, and it will be printed to the console.

Apply sum() to each row of rays_df, only looking at the 'RS' and 'RA' columns, and specify the correct axis.
# Gather total runs scored in all games per year
total_runs_scored = rays_df[['RS', 'RA']].____(____, axis=____)
print(total_runs_scored)

To gather the total runs scored in all games per year from the 'RS' and 'RA' columns of the `rays_df` DataFrame, you can apply the `.sum()` method to the selected columns. Here's how to complete the code:

```python
# Gather total runs scored in all games per year
total_runs_scored = rays_df[['RS', 'RA']].sum(axis=1)
print(total_runs_scored)
```

### Explanation:
- **`rays_df[['RS', 'RA']]`**: This selects the 'RS' (Runs Scored) and 'RA' (Runs Allowed) columns from the DataFrame.
- **`.sum(axis=1)`**: This applies the `sum()` function to each row (where `axis=1` indicates that the operation is applied horizontally, across columns).
- **`print(total_runs_scored)`**: This will display the total runs scored (by adding 'RS' and 'RA' for each year) for all rows in the DataFrame.

### Result:
When you run the code, `total_runs_scored` will contain the sum of 'RS' and 'RA' for each row, showing the total runs scored in all games per year.

Use .apply() and a lambda function to apply text_playoffs() to each row's 'Playoffs' value of the rays_df DataFrame.
# Convert numeric playoffs to text by applying text_playoffs()
textual_playoffs = rays_df.____(lambda row: ____(row['____']), axis=____)
print(textual_playoffs)


To use `.apply()` along with a lambda function to apply the `text_playoffs()` function to each row's 'Playoffs' value in the `rays_df` DataFrame, you can complete the code as follows:

```python
# Convert numeric playoffs to text by applying text_playoffs()
textual_playoffs = rays_df.apply(lambda row: text_playoffs(row['Playoffs']), axis=1)
print(textual_playoffs)
```

### Explanation:
- **`rays_df.apply(...)`**: This method is used to apply a function along a specified axis (in this case, rows).
- **`lambda row: text_playoffs(row['Playoffs'])`**: This lambda function takes each row of the DataFrame and applies the `text_playoffs()` function to the value in the 'Playoffs' column.
- **`axis=1`**: This specifies that the function should be applied across rows (as opposed to columns, which would be `axis=0`).
- **`print(textual_playoffs)`**: This will display the resulting series where the numeric values from the 'Playoffs' column are converted to their textual representations based on the `text_playoffs()` function.

### Result:
Running the code will create a new Series called `textual_playoffs` that contains the text representations of the playoffs for each row in the `rays_df` DataFrame.
