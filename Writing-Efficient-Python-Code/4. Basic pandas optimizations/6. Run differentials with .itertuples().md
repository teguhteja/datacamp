# Run differentials with .itertuples()

Run differentials with .itertuples()
The New York Yankees have made a trade with the San Francisco Giants for your analyst contractâ€” you're a hot commodity! Your new boss has seen your work with the Giants and now wants you to do something similar with the Yankees data. He'd like you to calculate run differentials for the Yankees from the year 1962 to the year 2012 and find which season they had the best run differential.

You've remembered the function you used when working with the Giants and quickly write it down:

def calc_run_diff(runs_scored, runs_allowed):

    run_diff = runs_scored - runs_allowed

    return run_diff
Let's use .itertuples() to loop over the yankees_df DataFrame (which has been loaded into your session) and calculate run differentials.

1
Use .itertuples() to loop over yankees_df and grab each row's runs scored and runs allowed values
run_diffs = []

# Loop over the DataFrame and calculate each row's run differential
for ____ in ____.____():
    
    runs_scored = ____
    runs_allowed = ____

To loop over `yankees_df` using `.itertuples()` and grab each row's runs scored and runs allowed values, you can complete the code as follows:

```python
run_diffs = []

# Loop over the DataFrame and calculate each row's run differential
for row in yankees_df.itertuples():
    
    runs_scored = row.RS       # Assuming 'RS' is the column name for runs scored
    runs_allowed = row.RA      # Assuming 'RA' is the column name for runs allowed
```

### Explanation:
- **`for row in yankees_df.itertuples():`**: This line iterates through each row of the DataFrame `yankees_df` using `.itertuples()`, which allows for accessing row attributes as if they were properties of an object.
- **`runs_scored = row.RS`**: This line retrieves the runs scored value from the current row.
- **`runs_allowed = row.RA`**: This line retrieves the runs allowed value from the current row.

You can further use `runs_scored` and `runs_allowed` for calculating run differentials or any other calculations as needed.

Now, calculate each row's run differential using calc_run_diff(). Be sure to append each row's run differential to run_diffs.

run_diffs = []

# Loop over the DataFrame and calculate each row's run differential
for row in yankees_df.itertuples():
    
    runs_scored = row.RS
    runs_allowed = row.RA

    run_diff = ____(____, ____)
    
    run_diffs.append(____)

To calculate each row's run differential using the `calc_run_diff()` function and append the result to the `run_diffs` list, you can complete the code as follows:

```python
run_diffs = []

# Loop over the DataFrame and calculate each row's run differential
for row in yankees_df.itertuples():
    
    runs_scored = row.RS
    runs_allowed = row.RA

    # Calculate the run differential using the provided function
    run_diff = calc_run_diff(runs_scored, runs_allowed)
    
    # Append each run differential to the output list
    run_diffs.append(run_diff)
```

### Explanation:
- **`run_diff = calc_run_diff(runs_scored, runs_allowed)`**: This line calls the `calc_run_diff` function with the runs scored and runs allowed as arguments, which calculates the run differential for that particular row.
- **`run_diffs.append(run_diff)`**: This line appends the calculated run differential to the `run_diffs` list, allowing you to store all run differentials for further analysis or reporting later on.

Append a new column called 'RD' to the yankees_df DataFrame that contains the run differentials you calculated.
run_diffs = []

# Loop over the DataFrame and calculate each row's run differential
for row in yankees_df.itertuples():
    
    runs_scored = row.RS
    runs_allowed = row.RA

    run_diff = calc_run_diff(runs_scored, runs_allowed)
    
    run_diffs.append(run_diff)

# Append new column
yankees_df[____] = ____
print(yankees_df)

To append a new column called 'RD' to the `yankees_df` DataFrame containing the run differentials calculated in the loop, you can complete the code as follows:

```python
run_diffs = []

# Loop over the DataFrame and calculate each row's run differential
for row in yankees_df.itertuples():
    
    runs_scored = row.RS
    runs_allowed = row.RA

    run_diff = calc_run_diff(runs_scored, runs_allowed)
    
    run_diffs.append(run_diff)

# Append new column
yankees_df['RD'] = run_diffs
print(yankees_df)
```

### Explanation:
- **`yankees_df['RD'] = run_diffs`**: This line creates a new column in the `yankees_df` DataFrame with the label 'RD' and assigns the list of run differentials (`run_diffs`) to that column. Each value in `run_diffs` will correspond to the appropriate row in the DataFrame. 
- The `print(yankees_df)` statement will display the updated DataFrame, now including the new column with the calculated run differentials.

Question
In what year within your DataFrame did the New York Yankees have the highest run differential?
You'll need to rerun the code that creates the 'RD' column if you'd like to analyze the DataFrame with code rather than looking at the console output.

Possible answers


In 2011 (with a Run Differential of 210)

In 1998 (with a Run Differential of 309)

In 1962 (with a Run Differential of 503)

In 1985 (with a Run Differential of 315)

To find out in which year the New York Yankees had the highest run differential, you'll need to analyze the DataFrame after creating the 'RD' column. Here's how you can do that:

```python
# Assuming you have already defined the function calc_run_diff() and have the yankees_df DataFrame ready

run_diffs = []

# Loop over the DataFrame and calculate each row's run differential
for row in yankees_df.itertuples():
    
    runs_scored = row.RS
    runs_allowed = row.RA

    run_diff = calc_run_diff(runs_scored, runs_allowed)
    
    run_diffs.append(run_diff)

# Append new column for run differentials
yankees_df['RD'] = run_diffs

# Find the year with the highest run differential
max_rd_row = yankees_df.loc[yankees_df['RD'].idxmax()]
year_with_highest_rd = max_rd_row.Year
highest_run_differential = max_rd_row.RD

print(f"In {year_with_highest_rd} (with a Run Differential of {highest_run_differential})")
```

### Explanation:
- **`yankees_df['RD'] = run_diffs`**: This line creates a new column in the DataFrame with the calculated run differentials.
- **`yankees_df['RD'].idxmax()`**: This returns the index of the row where the 'RD' column has its maximum value.
- **`yankees_df.loc[...]`**: This is used to retrieve the row corresponding to the maximum run differential.
- The final print statement outputs the year and the highest run differential.

### Possible Answer:
Based on the analysis, the correct answer should be the year and run differential returned by the code. You can run the code snippet above to find the specific year with the highest run differential for the New York Yankees. If you execute it, you should get either:

- **In 2011 (with a Run Differential of 210)**
- **In 1998 (with a Run Differential of 309)**
- **In 1962 (with a Run Differential of 503)**
- **In 1985 (with a Run Differential of 315)**

Make sure to compare the output of the print statement to determine which option matches your DataFrame's results!
