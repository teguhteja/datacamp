Bringing it all together: Predict win percentage
A pandas DataFrame (baseball_df) has been loaded into your session. For convenience, a dictionary describing each column within baseball_df has been printed into your console. You can reference these descriptions throughout the exercise.

You'd like to attempt to predict a team's win percentage for a given season by using the team's total runs scored in a season ('RS') and total runs allowed in a season ('RA') with the following function:

def predict_win_perc(RS, RA):
    prediction = RS ** 2 / (RS ** 2 + RA ** 2)
    return np.round(prediction, 2)
Let's compare the approaches you've learned to calculate a predicted win percentage for each season (or row) in your DataFrame.

Use a for loop and .itertuples() to predict the win percentage for each row of baseball_df with the predict_win_perc() function. Save each row's predicted win percentage as win_perc_pred and append each to the win_perc_preds_loop list.

win_perc_preds_loop = []

# Use a loop and .itertuples() to collect each row's predicted win percentage
for ____ in baseball_df.____():
    runs_scored = ____.____
    runs_allowed = ____.____
    win_perc_pred = predict_win_perc(____, ____)
    win_perc_preds_loop.append(____)

Hereâ€™s how to complete the code using a for loop and `.itertuples()` to predict the win percentage for each row of `baseball_df` with the `predict_win_perc()` function:

```python
win_perc_preds_loop = []

# Use a loop and .itertuples() to collect each row's predicted win percentage
for row in baseball_df.itertuples():
    runs_scored = row.RS        # Assuming 'RS' is the column for runs scored
    runs_allowed = row.RA       # Assuming 'RA' is the column for runs allowed
    win_perc_pred = predict_win_perc(runs_scored, runs_allowed)
    win_perc_preds_loop.append(win_perc_pred)
```

### Explanation:
- **`win_perc_preds_loop = []`** initializes an empty list to store the predicted win percentages.
- **`for row in baseball_df.itertuples():`** iterates over each row in the DataFrame as a named tuple.
- **`runs_scored = row.RS`** retrieves the runs scored from the current row.
- **`runs_allowed = row.RA`** retrieves the runs allowed from the current row.
- **`win_perc_pred = predict_win_perc(runs_scored, runs_allowed)`** calls the prediction function with the runs scored and allowed as arguments.
- **`win_perc_preds_loop.append(win_perc_pred)`** appends the predicted win percentage to the `win_perc_preds_loop` list. 

This setup will give you a list of predicted win percentages for each row in the DataFrame.

Apply predict_win_perc() to each row of the baseball_df DataFrame using a lambda function. Save the predicted win percentage as win_perc_preds_apply.
win_perc_preds_loop = []

# Use a loop and .itertuples() to collect each row's predicted win percentage
for row in baseball_df.itertuples():
    runs_scored = row.RS
    runs_allowed = row.RA
    win_perc_pred = predict_win_perc(runs_scored, runs_allowed)
    win_perc_preds_loop.append(win_perc_pred)

# Apply predict_win_perc to each row of the DataFrame
win_perc_preds_apply = baseball_df.____(lambda ____: predict_win_perc(row[____], row[____]), axis=____)

To apply the `predict_win_perc()` function to each row of the `baseball_df` DataFrame using a lambda function, you can complete the code as follows:

```python
# Apply predict_win_perc to each row of the DataFrame
win_perc_preds_apply = baseball_df.apply(lambda row: predict_win_perc(row['RS'], row['RA']), axis=1)
```

### Explanation:
- **`baseball_df.apply(...)`**: This method applies a function along the specified axis of the DataFrame.
- **`lambda row:`**: This defines an anonymous function that takes a single argument `row`, which represents each row in the DataFrame.
- **`predict_win_perc(row['RS'], row['RA'])`**: Inside the lambda function, it calls `predict_win_perc()` with the runs scored (`'RS'`) and runs allowed (`'RA'`) from the current row.
- **`axis=1`**: This specifies that the function should be applied to each row (as opposed to each column).

This code will create a new Series `win_perc_preds_apply` that contains the predicted win percentages for each row based on the runs scored and runs allowed.

Calculate the predicted win percentages by passing the underlying 'RS' and 'RA' arrays from baseball_df into predict_win_perc(). Save these predictions as win_perc_preds_np.
win_perc_preds_loop = []

# Use a loop and .itertuples() to collect each row's predicted win percentage
for row in baseball_df.itertuples():
    runs_scored = row.RS
    runs_allowed = row.RA
    win_perc_pred = predict_win_perc(runs_scored, runs_allowed)
    win_perc_preds_loop.append(win_perc_pred)

# Apply predict_win_perc to each row of the DataFrame
win_perc_preds_apply = baseball_df.apply(lambda row: predict_win_perc(row['RS'], row['RA']), axis=1)

# Calculate the win percentage predictions using NumPy arrays
win_perc_preds_np = predict_win_perc(baseball_df[____].____, baseball_df[____].____)
baseball_df['WP_preds'] = win_perc_preds_np
print(baseball_df.head())

To calculate the predicted win percentages using the underlying 'RS' (runs scored) and 'RA' (runs allowed) arrays from `baseball_df` and save these predictions as `win_perc_preds_np`, you can complete the code as follows:

```python
# Calculate the win percentage predictions using NumPy arrays
win_perc_preds_np = predict_win_perc(baseball_df['RS'].values, baseball_df['RA'].values)
baseball_df['WP_preds'] = win_perc_preds_np
print(baseball_df.head())
```

### Explanation:
- **`baseball_df['RS'].values`**: This extracts the values of the 'RS' column as a NumPy array.
- **`baseball_df['RA'].values`**: This extracts the values of the 'RA' column as a NumPy array.
- **`predict_win_perc(...)`**: This function is called with the two NumPy arrays (one for runs scored and one for runs allowed) to calculate the predicted win percentages.
- **`baseball_df['WP_preds'] = win_perc_preds_np`**: This assigns the calculated predicted win percentages to a new column called 'WP_preds' in the `baseball_df` DataFrame.

The `print(baseball_df.head())` statement will display the first few rows of the updated DataFrame, including the new 'WP_preds' column.

Question
Compare runtimes within your IPython console between all three approaches used to calculate the predicted win percentages.

Use %%timeit (cell magic mode) to time the six lines of code (not including comment lines) for the .itertuples() approach. You may need to press SHIFT+ENTER after entering %%timeit to get to a new line within your IPython console.

Use %timeit (line magic mode) to time the .apply() approach and the NumPy array approach separately. Each has only one line of code (not including comment lines).

What is the order of approaches from fastest to slowest?

Possible answers


The .apply() with a lambda function was the fastest, followed by the .itertuples() approach, and the array approach was slowest.

Using NumPy arrays was the fastest approach, followed by the .itertuples() approach, and the .apply() approach was slowest.

The .itertuples() approach was fastest, followed by the array approach, and the .apply() approach was slowest.

All three approaches had comparable runtimes.

To compare the runtimes of the three approaches used to calculate the predicted win percentages in your IPython console, you can follow these steps:

1. **Timing the `.itertuples()` approach** with `%%timeit`:

```python
%%timeit
win_perc_preds_loop = []
for row in baseball_df.itertuples():
    runs_scored = row.RS
    runs_allowed = row.RA
    win_perc_pred = predict_win_perc(runs_scored, runs_allowed)
    win_perc_preds_loop.append(win_perc_pred)
```

2. **Timing the `.apply()` approach** with `%timeit`:

```python
%timeit baseball_df.apply(lambda row: predict_win_perc(row['RS'], row['RA']), axis=1)
```

3. **Timing the NumPy array approach** with `%timeit`:

```python
%timeit predict_win_perc(baseball_df['RS'].values, baseball_df['RA'].values)
```

### Expected Order of Approaches from Fastest to Slowest
- Based on typical performance characteristics:
  - **Using NumPy arrays** is generally the fastest because it leverages vectorized operations.
  - **The `.itertuples()` approach** is often faster than using `.apply()` with a lambda function because it avoids the overhead of function calls for each row.
  - **The `.apply()` method** with a lambda function tends to be the slowest because it involves more overhead compared to direct iteration methods.

Thus, the likely order of approaches from fastest to slowest would be:

**Using NumPy arrays > .itertuples() > .apply() with a lambda function**

### Possible Answer
The answer that matches this conclusion would be:

**Using NumPy arrays was the fastest approach, followed by the .itertuples() approach, and the .apply() approach was slowest.**
