# Iterating with .iterrows()

Iterating with .iterrows()
In the video, we discussed that .iterrows() returns each DataFrame row as a tuple of (index, pandas Series) pairs. But, what does this mean? Let's explore with a few coding exercises.

A pandas DataFrame has been loaded into your session called pit_df. This DataFrame contains the stats for the Major League Baseball team named the Pittsburgh Pirates (abbreviated as 'PIT') from the year 2008 to the year 2012. It has been printed into your console for convenience.

Use .iterrows() to loop over pit_df and print each row. Save the first item from .iterrows() as i and the second as row.
# Iterate over pit_df and print each row
for ____,____ in ____.____:
    print(row)

To iterate over a Pandas DataFrame using the `.iterrows()` method and print each row, you can follow this structure. In your loop, the first item from `.iterrows()` will typically be the index (which we will call `i`), and the second item will be the actual row data (which we will call `row`). Here's how you can complete the code:

```python
# Iterate over pit_df and print each row
for i, row in pit_df.iterrows():
    print(row)
```

### Explanation:
- **`pit_df.iterrows()`**: This method generates an iterator that yields index and row pairs from the DataFrame.
- **`for i, row in ...:`**: This unpacks each item yielded by the iterator into `i` (the index) and `row` (the Series object representing the row).
- **`print(row)`**: This line prints each row as a Series, which shows the data for that particular row along with the column names. 

You can run this code snippet in your Python environment where `pit_df` is defined, and it will print each row from your DataFrame.

Add two lines to the loop: one before print(row) to print each index variable and one after to print each row's type.
# Iterate over pit_df and print each index variable, row, and row type
for i,row in pit_df.iterrows():
    ____
    print(row)
    ____

To add the required functionality to your loop, you can include one line to print the index variable `i` before printing the row and another line to print the type of the row after printing it. Here's how you can complete the code:

```python
# Iterate over pit_df and print each index variable, row, and row type
for i, row in pit_df.iterrows():
    print(i)  # Print the index variable
    print(row)  # Print the row
    print(type(row))  # Print the type of the row
```

### Explanation:
- **`print(i)`**: This line prints the index of the current row.
- **`print(row)`**: This line prints the current row's data.
- **`print(type(row))`**: This line prints the type of the `row`, which will typically be a Pandas Series, indicating that each row is represented as a Series object in the DataFrame iteration. 

You can run this code snippet in your Python environment, and it will display the index, row data, and the type of each row in your DataFrame `pit_df`.

Instead of using i and row in the for statement to store the output of .iterrows(), use one variable named row_tuple.
# Use one variable instead of two to store the result of .iterrows()
for ____ in ____.____:
    print(row_tuple)

To store the output of `.iterrows()` in one variable called `row_tuple`, you can modify the loop accordingly. Here's how you can write the code:

```python
# Use one variable instead of two to store the result of .iterrows()
for row_tuple in pit_df.iterrows():
    print(row_tuple)
```

### Explanation:
- **`for row_tuple in pit_df.iterrows():`**: This line iterates over each row in `pit_df`, where `row_tuple` will contain a tuple of the form `(index, Series)` for each row.
- **`print(row_tuple)`**: This will print the entire `row_tuple`, which includes both the index and the corresponding row data as a Pandas Series.

You can run this code snippet, and it will display each row's index along with the row's data in the form of a tuple.

Add a line in the for loop to print the type of each row_tuple.
# Print the row and type of each row
for row_tuple in pit_df.iterrows():
    print(row_tuple)
    ____

To print the type of each `row_tuple` within the for loop, you can add a line using the `type()` function. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```python
# Print the row and type of each row
for row_tuple in pit_df.iterrows():
    print(row_tuple)
    print(type(row_tuple))
```

### Explanation:
- **`print(row_tuple)`**: This line prints the content of `row_tuple`, which contains the index and the corresponding row data as a Pandas Series.
- **`print(type(row_tuple))`**: This line prints the type of `row_tuple`, which will typically be `<class 'tuple'>`, since `.iterrows()` returns a tuple containing the index and the row data. 

You can run this modified code snippet, and it will display both the contents of each row and the type of the `row_tuple` for each iteration.
