# Gathering Pokémon without a loop

Gathering Pokémon without a loop
A list containing 720 Pokémon has been loaded into your session as poke_names. Another list containing each Pokémon's corresponding generation has been loaded as poke_gens.

A for loop has been created to filter the Pokémon that belong to generation one or two, and collect the number of letters in each Pokémon's name:

gen1_gen2_name_lengths_loop = []

for name,gen in zip(poke_names, poke_gens):
    if gen < 3:
        name_length = len(name)
        poke_tuple = (name, name_length)
        gen1_gen2_name_lengths_loop.append(poke_tuple)

Eliminate the above for loop using list comprehension and the map() function:

Use list comprehension to collect each Pokémon that belongs to generation 1 or generation 2. Save this as gen1_gen2_pokemon.
Use the map() function to collect the number of letters in each Pokémon's name within the gen1_gen2_pokemon list. Save this map object as name_lengths_map.
Combine gen1_gen2_pokemon and name_lengths_map into a list called gen1_gen2_name_lengths.


# Collect Pokémon that belong to generation 1 or generation 2
gen1_gen2_pokemon = [name for name,gen in ____(____, ____) if gen < ____]

# Create a map object that stores the name lengths
name_lengths_map = ____(len, ____)

# Combine gen1_gen2_pokemon and name_lengths_map into a list
gen1_gen2_name_lengths = [*____(____, ____)]

print(gen1_gen2_name_lengths_loop[:5])
print(gen1_gen2_name_lengths[:5])

Here's how you can rewrite the code using list comprehension and the `map()` function:

```python
# Collect Pokémon that belong to generation 1 or generation 2
gen1_gen2_pokemon = [name for name, gen in zip(poke_names, poke_gens) if gen < 3]

# Create a map object that stores the name lengths
name_lengths_map = map(len, gen1_gen2_pokemon)

# Combine gen1_gen2_pokemon and name_lengths_map into a list of tuples
gen1_gen2_name_lengths = [*zip(gen1_gen2_pokemon, name_lengths_map)]

print(gen1_gen2_name_lengths_loop[:5])
print(gen1_gen2_name_lengths[:5])
```

### Explanation
- **List Comprehension**: The list comprehension filters out Pokémon from `poke_names` and `poke_gens` where the generation is less than 3 (i.e., generation 1 or 2).
- **map() Function**: `map(len, gen1_gen2_pokemon)` applies the `len()` function to each name in the `gen1_gen2_pokemon` list to get the length of each name.
- **Combining Using zip()**: `zip(gen1_gen2_pokemon, name_lengths_map)` combines the Pokémon names and their corresponding name lengths into tuples.

This approach is more concise and efficient, avoiding the need for an explicit loop.
