# Gathering unique Pokémon

Gathering unique Pokémon
A sample of 500 Pokémon has been created with replacement (meaning a Pokémon could be selected more than once and duplicates exist within the sample).

Three lists have been loaded into your session:

The names list contains the names of each Pokémon in the sample.
The primary_types list containing the corresponding primary type of each Pokémon in the sample.
The generations list contains the corresponding generation of each Pokémon in the sample.
The below function was written to gather unique values from each list:

def find_unique_items(data):
    uniques = []

    for item in data:
        if item not in uniques:
            uniques.append(item)

    return uniques
Let's compare the above function to using the set data type for collecting unique items.

Use the provided function to collect the unique Pokémon in the names list. Save this as uniq_names_func.
# Use the provided function to collect unique Pokémon names
uniq_names_func = ____(____)
print(len(uniq_names_func))

To collect the unique Pokémon names from the `names` list using the provided function, you would typically call the function and pass the list as an argument. Here is an example:

```python
# Use the provided function to collect unique Pokémon names
uniq_names_func = set(names)
print(len(uniq_names_func))
```

### Explanation
- If the provided function is something like `set()`, it will collect unique names from the `names` list by eliminating duplicates.
- `len(uniq_names_func)` gives the total count of unique Pokémon names. 

Make sure to replace `____` with the correct function name if a specific custom function has been provided in your environment. For example, if you were provided with a specific function named `collect_unique_names()`, you would write:

```python
uniq_names_func = collect_unique_names(names)
print(len(uniq_names_func))
```

2
Use a set data type to collect the unique Pokémon in the names list. Save this as uniq_names_set.
# Use find_unique_items() to collect unique Pokémon names
uniq_names_func = find_unique_items(names)
print(len(uniq_names_func))

# Convert the names list to a set to collect unique Pokémon names
uniq_names_set = ____
print(len(uniq_names_set))

# Check that both unique collections are equivalent
print(sorted(uniq_names_func) == sorted(uniq_names_set))

Here's how you can use a set to collect unique Pokémon names and check if both unique collections are equivalent:

```python
# Use find_unique_items() to collect unique Pokémon names
uniq_names_func = find_unique_items(names)
print(len(uniq_names_func))

# Convert the names list to a set to collect unique Pokémon names
uniq_names_set = set(names)
print(len(uniq_names_set))

# Check that both unique collections are equivalent
print(sorted(uniq_names_func) == sorted(uniq_names_set))
```

### Explanation
- `set(names)` collects unique Pokémon names by removing duplicates from the `names` list.
- `len(uniq_names_set)` gives the count of unique Pokémon names using the set.
- `sorted(uniq_names_func) == sorted(uniq_names_set)` checks if both collections contain the same unique items, regardless of order, by sorting them before comparing.

Question
Within your IPython console, use %timeit to compare the find_unique_items() function with using a set data type to collect unique Pokémon character names in names.

Which membership testing was faster?

Possible answers


Using a set to collect unique values is faster.

Using the provided function that uses a loop to gather unique items is faster.

Both approaches have the same runtime.

When you use `%timeit` to compare the performance of `find_unique_items()` and using a `set` directly, you are measuring which approach is faster for collecting unique values from the `names` list. Here's how you can perform this in the IPython console:

```python
# Timing the find_unique_items() function
%timeit find_unique_items(names)

# Timing the use of a set to collect unique Pokémon names
%timeit set(names)
```

### Likely Outcome
- **Using a set to collect unique values is faster.**
- This is because `set()` is implemented in C and optimized for performance, allowing for quick membership testing and duplicate removal using hashing.
- The `find_unique_items()` function, if implemented using loops, will generally be slower since it iterates through the list and checks each element manually.

### Correct Answer
> **Using a set to collect unique values is faster.**

Use the most efficient approach for gathering unique items to collect the unique Pokémon types (from the primary_types list) and Pokémon generations (from the generations list).


# Use find_unique_items() to collect unique Pokémon names
uniq_names_func = find_unique_items(names)
print(len(uniq_names_func))

# Convert the names list to a set to collect unique Pokémon names
uniq_names_set = set(names)
print(len(uniq_names_set))

# Check that both unique collections are equivalent
print(sorted(uniq_names_func) == sorted(uniq_names_set))

# Use the best approach to collect unique primary types and generations
uniq_types = ____ 
uniq_gens = ____
print(uniq_types, uniq_gens, sep='\n') 

To use the most efficient approach for collecting unique items from `primary_types` and `generations`, which is using the `set()` data type, you can do the following:

```python
# Use the best approach to collect unique primary types and generations
uniq_types = set(primary_types)
uniq_gens = set(generations)
print(uniq_types, uniq_gens, sep='\n')
```

### Explanation
- `set(primary_types)` collects unique Pokémon types by removing duplicates efficiently.
- `set(generations)` collects unique Pokémon generations in the same efficient way.
- This approach is faster and more efficient compared to using loops or custom functions for gathering unique items.
