# Combining Pokémon names and types

Combining Pokémon names and types
Three lists have been loaded into your session from a dataset that contains 720 Pokémon:

The names list contains the names of each Pokémon.
The primary_types list contains the corresponding primary type of each Pokémon.
The secondary_types list contains the corresponding secondary type of each Pokémon (nan if the Pokémon has only one type).
We want to combine each Pokémon's name and types together so that you easily see a description of each Pokémon. Practice using zip() to accomplish this task.

Combine the names list and the primary_types list into a new list object (called names_type1).
# Combine names and primary_types
names_type1 = [*____(____, ____)]

print(*names_type1[:5], sep='\n')

To combine the `names` list and the `primary_types` list into a new list object called `names_type1`, you can use the `zip()` function. Here's how you do it:

```python
# Assuming names and primary_types are already defined lists
names_type1 = [*zip(names, primary_types)]

# Printing the first 5 elements
print(*names_type1[:5], sep='\n')
```

### Explanation
- `zip(names, primary_types)` pairs each element of `names` with the corresponding element of `primary_types`.
- `[*zip(...)]` unpacks the zipped pairs into a list of tuples.
- `print(*names_type1[:5], sep='\n')` prints each of the first five elements on a new line. 

Make sure both `names` and `primary_types` have been properly defined before running this code.

Combine names, primary_types, and secondary_types (in that order) using zip() and unpack the zip object into a new list.
# Combine all three lists together
names_types = ____

print(*names_types[:5], sep='\n')

To combine `names`, `primary_types`, and `secondary_types` using `zip()` and unpack the zip object into a new list called `names_types`, you can do it like this:

```python
# Assuming names, primary_types, and secondary_types are already defined lists
names_types = [*zip(names, primary_types, secondary_types)]

# Printing the first 5 elements
print(*names_types[:5], sep='\n')
```

### Explanation
- `zip(names, primary_types, secondary_types)` creates a zip object that pairs elements from all three lists.
- `[*zip(...)]` unpacks the zipped pairs into a list of tuples.
- `print(*names_types[:5], sep='\n')` prints each of the first five tuples on a new line. 

Ensure that `names`, `primary_types`, and `secondary_types` have been defined and have the same length to avoid issues.

Use zip() to combine the first five items from the names list and the first three items from the primary_types list.
# Combine five items from names and three items from primary_types
differing_lengths = [*____(____, ____)]

print(*differing_lengths, sep='\n')

To combine the first five items from the `names` list and the first three items from the `primary_types` list using `zip()`, you can do the following:

```python
# Assuming names and primary_types are already defined lists
differing_lengths = [*zip(names[:5], primary_types[:3])]

# Printing the combined items
print(*differing_lengths, sep='\n')
```

### Explanation
- `names[:5]` gets the first five items from the `names` list.
- `primary_types[:3]` gets the first three items from the `primary_types` list.
- `zip()` pairs elements from both lists, but it will only create pairs until the shorter list is exhausted (in this case, only three pairs will be created).
- `[*zip(...)]` unpacks the zipped pairs into a list of tuples.
- `print(*differing_lengths, sep='\n')` prints each tuple on a new line.
