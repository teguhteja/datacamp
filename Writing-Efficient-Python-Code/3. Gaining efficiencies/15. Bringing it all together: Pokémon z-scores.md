# Bringing it all together: Pokémon z-scores

Bringing it all together: Pokémon z-scores
A list of 720 Pokémon has been loaded into your session as names. Each Pokémon's corresponding Health Points is stored in a NumPy array called hps. You want to analyze the Health Points using the z-score to see how many standard deviations each Pokémon's HP is from the mean of all HPs.

The below code was written to calculate the HP z-score for each Pokémon and gather the Pokémon with the highest HPs based on their z-scores:

poke_zscores = []

for name,hp in zip(names, hps):
    hp_avg = hps.mean()
    hp_std = hps.std()
    z_score = (hp - hp_avg)/hp_std
    poke_zscores.append((name, hp, z_score))
highest_hp_pokemon = []

for name,hp,zscore in poke_zscores:
    if zscore > 2:
        highest_hp_pokemon.append((name, hp, zscore))

Use NumPy to eliminate the for loop used to create the z-scores.
Then, combine the names, hps, and z_scores objects together into a list called poke_zscores2.

# Calculate the total HP avg and total HP standard deviation
hp_avg = ____.____
hp_std = ____.____

# Use NumPy to eliminate the previous for loop
z_scores = (____ - ____)/____

# Combine names, hps, and z_scores
poke_zscores2 = [*____(names, hps, z_scores)]
print(*poke_zscores2[:3], sep='\n')

To eliminate the for loop for creating z-scores using NumPy and combine the names, HP values, and z-scores into a single list, you can follow the steps outlined below:

```python
import numpy as np

# Calculate the total HP avg and total HP standard deviation
hp_avg = np.mean(hps)
hp_std = np.std(hps)

# Use NumPy to eliminate the previous for loop
z_scores = (hps - hp_avg) / hp_std

# Combine names, hps, and z_scores
poke_zscores2 = [*zip(names, hps, z_scores)]
print(*poke_zscores2[:3], sep='\n')
```

### Explanation:
1. **Calculating Average and Standard Deviation**:
   - `hp_avg` is calculated using `np.mean(hps)` which gives the average of the HP values.
   - `hp_std` is calculated using `np.std(hps)` which provides the standard deviation of the HP values.

2. **Calculating Z-Scores**:
   - The z-scores are computed using the formula \((x - \mu) / \sigma\), where \(x\) is the HP value, \(\mu\) is the average, and \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation. This is done directly using NumPy's array operations, which is efficient and eliminates the need for an explicit for loop.

3. **Combining Data**:
   - The `zip` function is used to combine `names`, `hps`, and `z_scores` into a list of tuples, which is then unpacked into a list called `poke_zscores2`.

4. **Output**:
   - The first three entries of `poke_zscores2` are printed to show the results.

This approach effectively streamlines the process using NumPy's capabilities for array operations, ensuring efficient computation.

Use list comprehension to replace the for loop used to collect Pokémon with the highest HPs based on their z-score.

# Calculate the total HP avg and total HP standard deviation
hp_avg = hps.mean()
hp_std = hps.std()

# Use NumPy to eliminate the previous for loop
z_scores = (hps - hp_avg)/hp_std

# Combine names, hps, and z_scores
poke_zscores2 = [*zip(names, hps, z_scores)]
print(*poke_zscores2[:3], sep='\n')

# Use list comprehension with the same logic as the highest_hp_pokemon code block
highest_hp_pokemon2 = [(____, ____, ____) for ____,____,____ in poke_zscores2 if ____ > ____]
print(*highest_hp_pokemon2, sep='\n')

Certainly! Let's break down the code step by step to understand what each part does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of calculating z-scores for Pokémon HP and identifying Pokémon with high HP.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

#### 1. **Calculate the Average and Standard Deviation of HP**

```python
# Calculate the total HP avg and total HP standard deviation
hp_avg = hps.mean()  # Compute the average (mean) HP from the hps array
hp_std = hps.std()   # Compute the standard deviation of HP from the hps array
```

- **`hp_avg = hps.mean()`**: This line calculates the mean (average) of the HP values stored in the `hps` array using the `.mean()` method from NumPy. This average serves as a baseline to determine how far individual HP values deviate from the norm.
  
- **`hp_std = hps.std()`**: Similarly, this line calculates the standard deviation of the HP values. The standard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates a wide range of values.

#### 2. **Calculate Z-Scores**

```python
# Use NumPy to eliminate the previous for loop
z_scores = (hps - hp_avg) / hp_std  # Calculate z-scores for HP values
```

```py
# Calculate the total HP avg and total HP standard deviation
hp_avg = hps.mean()
hp_std = hps.std()

# Use NumPy to eliminate the previous for loop
z_scores = (hps - hp_avg)/hp_std

# Combine names, hps, and z_scores
poke_zscores2 = [*zip(names, hps, z_scores)]
print(*poke_zscores2[:3], sep='\n')

# Use list comprehension with the same logic as the highest_hp_pokemon code block
highest_hp_pokemon2 = [(name, hp, zscore) for name,hp,zscore in poke_zscores2 if zscore > 2]
print(*highest_hp_pokemon2, sep='\n')

```

- **`z_scores = (hps - hp_avg) / hp_std`**: This line calculates the z-scores for each Pokémon's HP. The z-score is a statistical measurement that describes a value's relationship to the mean of a group of values. The formula used here is:

  \[
  z = \frac{(X - \mu)}{\sigma}
  \]

  where:
  - \(X\) is the individual HP value.
  - \(\mu\) is the mean HP (calculated previously).
  - \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation of HP (calculated previously).
  
  The result is an array of z-scores, where a positive z-score indicates that the Pokémon's HP is above the average, and a negative z-score indicates it is below the average.

#### 3. **Combine Names, HPs, and Z-Scores**

```python
# Combine names, hps, and z_scores
poke_zscores2 = [*zip(names, hps, z_scores)]  # Create tuples of (name, HP, z-score)
print(*poke_zscores2[:3], sep='\n')  # Print the first three tuples for verification
```

- **`poke_zscores2 = [*zip(names, hps, z_scores)]`**: This line uses the `zip` function to combine the lists of Pokémon names, their HPs, and their calculated z-scores into a list of tuples. Each tuple consists of a Pokémon's name, HP, and z-score.
  
- **`print(*poke_zscores2[:3], sep='\n')`**: This line prints the first three entries in the combined list to verify that the tuples were created correctly.

#### 4. **Find Pokémon with High Z-Scores**

```python
# Use list comprehension with the same logic as the highest_hp_pokemon code block
highest_hp_pokemon2 = [(name, hp, zscore) for name, hp, zscore in poke_zscores2 if zscore > 2]
print(*highest_hp_pokemon2, sep='\n')  # Print Pokémon with z-scores greater than 2
```

- **`highest_hp_pokemon2 = [(name, hp, zscore) for name, hp, zscore in poke_zscores2 if zscore > 2]`**: This line uses a list comprehension to filter the `poke_zscores2` list, creating a new list that contains only those Pokémon whose z-scores are greater than 2. This means that these Pokémon have HP values significantly above average (more than two standard deviations above the mean).
  
- **`print(*highest_hp_pokemon2, sep='\n')`**: Finally, this line prints the resulting list of Pokémon with high HP, displaying their names, HP values, and z-scores.

### Conclusion
This code efficiently calculates the z-scores for each Pokémon based on their HP and identifies those with exceptionally high HP by leveraging NumPy for computations and list comprehensions for data filtering. This approach avoids traditional loops, improving both performance and readability.

Use %%timeit (cell magic mode) within your IPython console to compare the runtimes between the original code blocks and the new code you developed using NumPy and list comprehension.

Don't include the print() statements when timing. You should include ten lines of code when timing the original code blocks and five lines of code when timing the new code you developed. You may need to press SHIFT+ENTER after entering %%timeit to get to a new line within your IPython console.

Which approach was the faster?

Possible answers


The total time for executing both of the original code blocks was faster.

The total time for executing the updated solution using NumPy and list comprehension was faster.

Both approaches had the same execution time.


To compare the execution times between the original code blocks and the optimized version using NumPy and list comprehension, you'll want to set up your IPython console to use the `%%timeit` cell magic. Below, I'll outline how to structure the timing tests for both versions of the code and provide guidance on how to interpret the results.

### Step 1: Original Code Blocks Timing

In your IPython console, enter the following code with `%%timeit` at the top of the cell to time the original blocks. Make sure to exclude any `print()` statements to ensure accurate timing.

```python
%%timeit

# Original Code Block for HP Average and Standard Deviation
hp_avg = hps.mean()
hp_std = hps.std()

# Original Code Block for Z-Scores Calculation
z_scores = []
for hp in hps:
    z_score = (hp - hp_avg) / hp_std
    z_scores.append(z_score)

# Combine names, hps, and z_scores
poke_zscores1 = [*zip(names, hps, z_scores)]
highest_hp_pokemon1 = [(name, hp, zscore) for name, hp, zscore in poke_zscores1 if zscore > 2]
```

### Step 2: Optimized Code Blocks Timing

Next, enter the following code with `%%timeit` to time the new, optimized version of the code:

```python
%%timeit

# Optimized Code Block Using NumPy
hp_avg = hps.mean()
hp_std = hps.std()
z_scores = (hps - hp_avg) / hp_std
poke_zscores2 = [*zip(names, hps, z_scores)]
highest_hp_pokemon2 = [(name, hp, zscore) for name, hp, zscore in poke_zscores2 if zscore > 2]
```

### Step 3: Run and Compare

- After entering each of the above code blocks, press **SHIFT+ENTER** to run the cell and obtain the timing results for each approach.
- The output will provide you with the average execution time for both the original and the optimized code blocks.

### Interpreting the Results

Once you have both timing results:

- **If the total time for the original code blocks is less than the new optimized version**, you would select:
  - **"The total time for executing both of the original code blocks was faster."**
  
- **If the new optimized solution using NumPy and list comprehension is faster**, you would choose:
  - **"The total time for executing the updated solution using NumPy and list comprehension was faster."**
  
- **If both approaches yield similar execution times**, you would state:
  - **"Both approaches had the same execution time."**

### Conclusion

Using `%%timeit` is a great way to benchmark performance in Python, especially when comparing traditional loops with optimized NumPy operations. You'll likely find that the NumPy-based approach performs better due to its efficiency in handling array operations.
