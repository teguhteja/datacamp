# Searching for Pokémon

Searching for Pokémon
Two Pokémon trainers, Ash and Brock, have a collection of ten Pokémon each. Each trainer's Pokédex (their collection of Pokémon) has been loaded into your session as lists called ash_pokedex and brock_pokedex respectively.

You'd like to see if certain Pokémon are members of either Ash or Brock's Pokédex.

Let's compare using a set versus using a list when performing this membership testing.

Convert Brock's Pokédex list (brock_pokedex) to a set called brock_pokedex_set.

# Convert Brock's Pokédex to a set
brock_pokedex_set = ____
print(brock_pokedex_set)

You can convert Brock's Pokédex list to a set as follows:

```python
# Convert Brock's Pokédex to a set
brock_pokedex_set = set(brock_pokedex)
print(brock_pokedex_set)
```

### Explanation
- `set(brock_pokedex)` converts the `brock_pokedex` list into a set, removing any duplicate Pokémon if they exist.
- `print(brock_pokedex_set)` displays the set of Pokémon in Brock's Pokédex.

Check if 'Psyduck' is in Ash's Pokédex list (ash_pokedex) and if 'Psyduck' is in Brock's Pokédex set (brock_pokedex_set).

# Convert Brock's Pokédex to a set
brock_pokedex_set = set(brock_pokedex)
print(brock_pokedex_set)

# Check if Psyduck is in Ash's list and Brock's set
print('Psyduck' ____ ____)
print('Psyduck' ____ ____)

You can check if `'Psyduck'` is in Ash's Pokédex list and Brock's Pokédex set like this:

```python
# Convert Brock's Pokédex to a set
brock_pokedex_set = set(brock_pokedex)
print(brock_pokedex_set)

# Check if Psyduck is in Ash's list and Brock's set
print('Psyduck' in ash_pokedex)
print('Psyduck' in brock_pokedex_set)
```

### Explanation
- `'Psyduck' in ash_pokedex` checks if `'Psyduck'` is an element in Ash's Pokédex list.
- `'Psyduck' in brock_pokedex_set` checks if `'Psyduck'` is an element in Brock's Pokédex set.
- Both `print()` statements display `True` or `False` based on whether `'Psyduck'` is found in the respective collections.

Check if 'Machop' is in Ash's Pokédex list (ash_pokedex) and if 'Machop' is in Brock's Pokédex set (brock_pokedex_set).

# Convert Brock's Pokédex to a set
brock_pokedex_set = set(brock_pokedex)
print(brock_pokedex_set)

# Check if Psyduck is in Ash's list and Brock's set
print('Psyduck' in ash_pokedex)
print('Psyduck' in brock_pokedex_set)

# Check if Machop is in Ash's list and Brock's set
print(____)
print(____)

To check if `'Machop'` is in Ash's Pokédex list and in Brock's Pokédex set, you can write:

```python
# Convert Brock's Pokédex to a set
brock_pokedex_set = set(brock_pokedex)
print(brock_pokedex_set)

# Check if Psyduck is in Ash's list and Brock's set
print('Psyduck' in ash_pokedex)
print('Psyduck' in brock_pokedex_set)

# Check if Machop is in Ash's list and Brock's set
print('Machop' in ash_pokedex)
print('Machop' in brock_pokedex_set)
```

### Explanation
- `'Machop' in ash_pokedex` checks if `'Machop'` is in Ash's Pokédex list.
- `'Machop' in brock_pokedex_set` checks if `'Machop'` is in Brock's Pokédex set.
- Both `print()` statements will output `True` or `False` depending on whether `'Machop'` is present in the respective collections.

Question
Within your IPython console, use %timeit to compare membership testing for 'Psyduck' in ash_pokedex, 'Psyduck' in brock_pokedex_set, 'Machop' in ash_pokedex, and 'Machop' in brock_pokedex_set (a total of four different timings).

Don't include the print() function. Only time the commands that you wrote inside the print() function in the previous steps.

Which membership testing was faster?

Possible answers


Using a list is faster than using a set for membership testing in all four cases.

Member testing using a list and a set have the same runtimes for all four cases.

Member testing using a set is faster than using a list in all four cases.

When you run `%timeit` on these membership tests, you should observe the difference in performance between testing membership in a list and a set. Here's how you would write and run each test in the IPython console:

```python
# Membership testing for 'Psyduck' in a list
%timeit 'Psyduck' in ash_pokedex

# Membership testing for 'Psyduck' in a set
%timeit 'Psyduck' in brock_pokedex_set

# Membership testing for 'Machop' in a list
%timeit 'Machop' in ash_pokedex

# Membership testing for 'Machop' in a set
%timeit 'Machop' in brock_pokedex_set
```

### Explanation
- Using `%timeit` helps measure the execution time of these membership tests and compare them.
- **Sets** have **O(1) average-time complexity** for membership testing because of their underlying hash table implementation.
- **Lists** have **O(n) time complexity** for membership testing since they need to iterate through each element until a match is found.

### Likely Outcome
**Membership testing using a set is faster than using a list in all four cases.**

- **Sets** are optimized for quick membership testing due to hashing.
- **Lists** are slower for this operation because they require linear searches.

Thus, the correct answer is:
> **Member testing using a set is faster than using a list in all four cases.**
