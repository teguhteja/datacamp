# Bringing it all together: Star Wars profiling

Bringing it all together: Star Wars profiling
A list of 480 superheroes has been loaded into your session (called heroes) as well as a list of each hero's corresponding publisher (called publishers).

You'd like to filter the heroes list based on a hero's specific publisher, but are unsure which of the below functions is more efficient.

def get_publisher_heroes(heroes, publishers, desired_publisher):

    desired_heroes = []

    for i,pub in enumerate(publishers):
        if pub == desired_publisher:
            desired_heroes.append(heroes[i])

    return desired_heroes
def get_publisher_heroes_np(heroes, publishers, desired_publisher):

    heroes_np = np.array(heroes)
    pubs_np = np.array(publishers)

    desired_heroes = heroes_np[pubs_np == desired_publisher]

    return desired_heroes

Use the get_publisher_heroes() function and the get_publisher_heroes_np() function to collect heroes from the Star Wars universe. The desired_publisher for Star Wars is 'George Lucas'.

```py
# Use get_publisher_heroes() to gather Star Wars heroes
star_wars_heroes = get_publisher_heroes(____, ____, ____)

print(star_wars_heroes)
print(type(star_wars_heroes))

# Use get_publisher_heroes_np() to gather Star Wars heroes
star_wars_heroes_np = get_publisher_heroes_np(____, ____, ____)

print(star_wars_heroes_np)
print(type(star_wars_heroes_np))

```

The error message you're encountering, `NameError: name 'hts' is not defined`, indicates that the variable `hts` has not been defined in your code before you try to use it as an argument in the `get_publisher_heroes()` function call. Here are a few steps to help you resolve this issue:

### Steps to Fix the Error

1. **Define `hts` and `wts`:**
   Ensure that both `hts` (heights) and `wts` (weights) variables are defined before you call `get_publisher_heroes()`. They should be lists or NumPy arrays containing the corresponding data for each hero in the `heroes` list.

   Example:
   ```python
   # Sample data (make sure to replace these with your actual data)
   heroes = ['Luke Skywalker', 'Darth Vader', 'Princess Leia']
   hts = [172, 202, 150]  # Heights in cm
   wts = [77, 136, 55]     # Weights in kg
   ```

2. **Check Variable Names:**
   Make sure the variable names match exactly. For instance, if you defined your heights and weights as `height_list` and `weight_list`, you would need to use those names in the function call instead of `hts` and `wts`.

3. **Use the Function Calls After Defining Variables:**
   Place the function calls only after the variables have been defined.

### Example Code

Hereâ€™s how your code should look after addressing the above points:

```python
# Sample data
heroes = ['Luke Skywalker', 'Darth Vader', 'Princess Leia']
hts = [172, 202, 150]  # Heights in cm
wts = [77, 136, 55]     # Weights in kg

# Use get_publisher_heroes() to gather Star Wars heroes
star_wars_heroes = get_publisher_heroes(heroes, hts, wts)

print(star_wars_heroes)
print(type(star_wars_heroes))

# Use get_publisher_heroes_np() to gather Star Wars heroes
star_wars_heroes_np = get_publisher_heroes_np(heroes, hts, wts)

print(star_wars_heroes_np)
print(type(star_wars_heroes_np))
```

### Additional Tips
- If you have not yet loaded the superhero data or if `heroes`, `hts`, and `wts` should come from a data file or API, make sure to include that code before using the variables.
- If `get_publisher_heroes()` and `get_publisher_heroes_np()` require any specific formats or data types, ensure that your inputs match those requirements.

Question
Within your IPython console, load the line_profiler and use %lprun to profile the two functions for line-by-line runtime. When using %lprun, use each function to gather the Star Wars heroes as you did in the previous step. After you've finished profiling, answer the following question:
Which function has the fastest runtime?

Possible answers


get_publisher_heroes() is faster.

get_publisher_heroes_np() is faster.

Both functions have the same runtime.




To determine which function, `get_publisher_heroes()` or `get_publisher_heroes_np()`, has the fastest runtime using the `line_profiler`, follow these steps in your IPython console:

### Steps to Profile Functions with `%lprun`

1. **Load the `line_profiler` Extension:**
   You need to load the `line_profiler` module in your IPython session.

   ```python
   %load_ext line_profiler
   ```

2. **Profile Each Function:**
   Use the `%lprun` command to profile each function individually. Make sure you have your superhero data loaded.

   ```python
   # Profile the first function
   %lprun -f get_publisher_heroes get_publisher_heroes(heroes, hts, wts)

   # Profile the second function
   %lprun -f get_publisher_heroes_np get_publisher_heroes_np(heroes, hts, wts)
   ```

3. **Analyze the Output:**
   After running the profiling commands, the output will show the line-by-line runtime for each function. You can compare the total time spent in each function to determine which one is faster.

### Expected Outcomes

- **Compare Runtime Results:**
  - Look for the total runtime displayed for each function in the profiling output.
  - The function with the lower total runtime is the faster one.

### Conclusion
Based on the results from profiling:

- If `get_publisher_heroes()` has a lower runtime, the answer is:
  - **get_publisher_heroes() is faster.**

- If `get_publisher_heroes_np()` has a lower runtime, the answer is:
  - **get_publisher_heroes_np() is faster.**

- If both functions have similar runtimes, the answer is:
  - **Both functions have the same runtime.**

### Final Answer
After analyzing the output of the line profiler, choose the correct option based on which function has the fastest runtime.

Based on your runtime profiling and memory allocation profiling, which function would you choose to gather Star Wars heroes?

Possible answers


I would use get_publisher_heroes().

I would use get_publisher_heroes_np().

I could use either function since their runtimes, and memory usage were identical.


To determine which function to use for gathering Star Wars heroes, consider the following based on your runtime profiling and memory allocation profiling results:

1. **If `get_publisher_heroes_np()` showed significantly faster runtime and lower memory allocation**:
   - **Choose:** **I would use `get_publisher_heroes_np()`.**
   - **Rationale:** The use of NumPy typically leads to more efficient computations, especially with large datasets.

2. **If `get_publisher_heroes()` had a faster runtime or significantly lower memory usage**:
   - **Choose:** **I would use `get_publisher_heroes()`.**
   - **Rationale:** It might be more suitable if it performs better in your specific context.

3. **If both functions had similar runtimes and memory usage**:
   - **Choose:** **I could use either function since their runtimes, and memory usage were identical.**
   - **Rationale:** In this case, you can select based on other factors, such as readability or familiarity.

### Final Choice
Based on the outcomes of your profiling sessions, select the option that best reflects your findings. If `get_publisher_heroes_np()` consistently outperformed the other function, it would generally be the better choice.
