# Using %lprun: fix the bottleneck


Using %lprun: fix the bottleneck
In the previous exercise, you profiled the convert_units() function and saw that the new_hts list comprehension could be a potential bottleneck. Did you notice that the new_wts list comprehension also accounted for a similar percentage of the runtime? This is an indication that you may want to create the new_hts and new_wts objects using a different technique.

Since the height and weight of each hero is stored in a numpy array, you can use array broadcasting rather than list comprehension to convert the heights and weights. This has been implemented in the below function:

def convert_units_broadcast(heroes, heights, weights):

    # Array broadcasting instead of list comprehension
    new_hts = heights * 0.39370
    new_wts = weights * 2.20462

    hero_data = {}

    for i,hero in enumerate(heroes):
        hero_data[hero] = (new_hts[i], new_wts[i])

    return hero_data
Load the line_profiler package into your IPython session. Then, use %lprun to profile the convert_units_broadcast() function acting on your superheroes data. The convert_units_broadcast() function, heroes list, hts array, and wts array have been loaded into your session. After you've finished coding, answer the following question:

What percentage of time is spent on the new_hts array broadcasting line of code relative to the total amount of time spent in the convert_units_broadcast() function?

0% - 10%

11% - 20%

21% - 50%

51% - 100%

To profile the `convert_units_broadcast()` function and determine the percentage of time spent on the `new_hts` array broadcasting line relative to the total time spent in the function, follow these steps in your IPython session:

### Steps to Profile the Function

1. **Load the line_profiler package:**
   ```python
   %load_ext line_profiler
   ```

2. **Profile the `convert_units_broadcast()` function:**
   Use the `%lprun` command with the `-f` flag to specify the function to profile. This command should be structured like this:
   ```python
   %lprun -f convert_units_broadcast convert_units_broadcast(heroes, hts, wts)
   ```

3. **Analyze the Output:**
   After running the above command, youâ€™ll get a detailed output showing how much time was spent on each line of the `convert_units_broadcast()` function. Specifically, look for the time taken by the array broadcasting line for `new_hts`:
   ```python
   new_hts = heights * 0.39370
   ```

4. **Calculate the Percentage:**
   - **Total Time**: Check for the total time spent in the `convert_units_broadcast()` function.
   - **Time on `new_hts`**: Find the time taken for the `new_hts` array broadcasting.
   - Use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time on } new\_hts}{\text{Total Time}} \right) \times 100
     \]

### Possible Answers
Based on the profiling results, you can choose the correct answer:

- **0% - 10%** (X)
- **11% - 20%**
- **21% - 50%**
- **51% - 100%**

That's correct! By profiling the convert_units() function, you were able to see that using list comprehension was not the most efficient solution for creating the new_hts and new_wts objects. You also saw that using array broadcasting in the convert_units_broadcast() function dramatically decreased the percentage of time spent executing these lines of code. You may have noticed that your function still takes a while to iterate through the for loop. Don't worry; you'll cover how to make this loop more efficient in a later chapter.

### Conclusion
After executing the profiling and calculating the percentage, select the option that best represents the time spent on the `new_hts` line relative to the total runtime of the `convert_units_broadcast()` function. If the array broadcasting significantly reduces the runtime compared to the previous list comprehension, this indicates an effective optimization.
