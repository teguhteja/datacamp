# Using %timeit: specifying number of runs and loops

Using %timeit: specifying number of runs and loops
A list of 480 superheroes has been loaded into your session (called heroes). You'd like to analyze the runtime for converting this heroes list into a set. Instead of relying on the default settings for %timeit, you'd like to only use 5 runs and 25 loops per each run.

What is the correct syntax when using %timeit and only using 5 runs with 25 loops per each run?

timeit -runs5 -loops25 set(heroes)

%%timeit -r5 -n25 set(heroes)

%timeit set(heroes), 5, 25

%timeit -r5 -n25 set(heroes)

The correct syntax for using `%timeit` with 5 runs and 25 loops per run is:

```python
%timeit -r5 -n25 set(heroes)
```

### Explanation:
- `-r5` specifies 5 runs (repeating the full measurement 5 times).
- `-n25` specifies 25 loops per each run.
  
So the correct answer is:

**`%timeit -r5 -n25 set(heroes)`**
