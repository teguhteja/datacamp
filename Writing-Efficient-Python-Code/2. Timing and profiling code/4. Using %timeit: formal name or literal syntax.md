# Using %timeit: formal name or literal syntax

Using %timeit: formal name or literal syntax
Python allows you to create data structures using either a formal name or a literal syntax. In this exercise, you'll explore how using a literal syntax for creating a data structure can speed up runtimes.

data structure	formal name	literal syntax
list	list()	[]
dictionary	dict()	{}
tuple	tuple()	()

1
Create an empty list called formal_list using the formal name (list()).
Create an empty list called literal_list using the literal syntax ([]).

```py
# Create a list using the formal name
formal_list = ____
print(formal_list)

# Create a list using the literal syntax
literal_list = ____
print(literal_list)
```

Here's how to create an empty list using both the formal name (`list()`) and the literal syntax (`[]`):

```python
# Create a list using the formal name
formal_list = list()
print(formal_list)

# Create a list using the literal syntax
literal_list = []
print(literal_list)
```

### Explanation:
- `list()` creates an empty list using the formal `list` constructor.
- `[]` creates an empty list using the literal syntax, which is often more concise.

2
Print out the type of formal_list and literal_list to show that both naming conventions create a list.

```py
# Create a list using the formal name
formal_list = list()
print(formal_list)

# Create a list using the literal syntax
literal_list = []
print(literal_list)

# Print out the type of formal_list
print(type(____))

# Print out the type of literal_list
print(____(____))

```

Hereâ€™s how to print the type of both `formal_list` and `literal_list` to confirm they are both lists:

```python
# Create a list using the formal name
formal_list = list()
print(formal_list)

# Create a list using the literal syntax
literal_list = []
print(literal_list)

# Print out the type of formal_list
print(type(formal_list))

# Print out the type of literal_list
print(type(literal_list))
```

### Explanation:
- `type(formal_list)` and `type(literal_list)` both return `<class 'list'>`, showing that both methods create a list.

Question
Use %timeit in your IPython console to compare runtimes between creating a list using the formal name (list()) and the literal syntax ([]). Don't include the print() statements when timing.

Which naming convention is faster?

Possible answers


Using the formal name (list()) to create a list is faster.

Using the literal syntax ([]) to create a list is faster.

Both naming conventions have the same runtime.


To compare the runtimes of creating a list with `list()` versus `[]`, you can use `%timeit` in your IPython console as follows:

1. For creating an empty list with the formal name:

   ```python
   %timeit list()
   ```

2. For creating an empty list with the literal syntax:

   ```python
   %timeit []
   ```

### Expected Result
The **literal syntax (`[]`)** is generally faster than using `list()` because `[]` is a direct operation in Python, whereas `list()` involves calling a function. This slight difference in execution time can be observed with `%timeit`.

So, the correct answer is:

**"Using the literal syntax (`[]`) to create a list is faster."**
