# Using %mprun: Hero BMI

Using %mprun: Hero BMI
You'd like to calculate the body mass index (BMI) for a selected sample of heroes. BMI can be calculated using the below formula:

BMI = mass(kg) / height(m)^2

A random sample of 25,000 superheroes has been loaded into your session as an array called sample_indices. This sample is a list of indices that corresponds to each superhero's index selected from the heroes list.

A function named calc_bmi_lists has also been created and saved to a file titled bmi_lists.py. For convenience, it is displayed below:

def calc_bmi_lists(sample_indices, hts, wts):

    # Gather sample heights and weights as lists
    s_hts = [hts[i] for i in sample_indices]
    s_wts = [wts[i] for i in sample_indices]

    # Convert heights from cm to m and square with list comprehension
    s_hts_m_sqr = [(ht / 100) ** 2 for ht in s_hts]

    # Calculate BMIs as a list with list comprehension
    bmis = [s_wts[i] / s_hts_m_sqr[i] for i in range(len(sample_indices))]

    return bmis
Notice that this function performs all necessary calculations using list comprehension (hence the name calc_bmi_lists()). Dig deeper into this function and analyze the memory footprint for performing your calculations using lists:

Load the memory_profiler package into your IPython session.
Import calc_bmi_lists from bmi_lists.
Once you've completed the above steps, use %mprun to profile the calc_bmi_lists() function acting on your superheroes data. The hts array and wts array have already been loaded into your session.
After you've finished coding, answer the following question:

How much memory do the list comprehension lines of code consume in the calc_bmi_lists() function? (i.e., what is the total sum of the Increment column for these four lines of code?)

0.0 MiB


To analyze the memory footprint of the `calc_bmi_lists()` function using `%mprun`, follow these steps:

### Steps to Profile Memory Usage

1. **Load the Memory Profiler:**
   Start by loading the `memory_profiler` package into your IPython session:
   ```python
   %load_ext memory_profiler
   ```

2. **Import the Function:**
   Import the `calc_bmi_lists` function from the `bmi_lists.py` file:
   ```python
   from bmi_lists import calc_bmi_lists
   ```

3. **Profile the Function:**
   Use `%mprun` to profile the `calc_bmi_lists()` function with your superhero data:
   ```python
   bmis = %mprun -f calc_bmi_lists calc_bmi_lists(sample_indices, hts, wts)
   ```

4. **Review the Output:**
   After running the profiling command, review the output in the IPython console. Look specifically for the "Increment" column associated with the list comprehension lines in the `calc_bmi_lists()` function.

### Lines of Interest
The lines in the `calc_bmi_lists()` function that you should pay attention to for memory consumption are:
- Gathering sample heights:
  ```python
  s_hts = [hts[i] for i in sample_indices]
  ```
- Gathering sample weights:
  ```python
  s_wts = [wts[i] for i in sample_indices]
  ```
- Converting heights to meters and squaring them:
  ```python
  s_hts_m_sqr = [(ht / 100) ** 2 for ht in s_hts]
  ```
- Calculating BMIs:
  ```python
  bmis = [s_wts[i] / s_hts_m_sqr[i] for i in range(len(sample_indices))]
  ```

### Conclusion
After analyzing the memory consumption for these lines, you can answer the question regarding the total sum of the Increment column for these four lines of code.

Based on typical profiling results, the expected memory consumption might be one of the following options:
- **20.0 MiB - 30.0 MiB**
- **0.1 MiB - 5.0 MiB**
- **10.0 MiB - 15.0 MiB**
- **0.0 MiB**

To select the correct answer, check the profiling output you generated and find the total increment. The most common range for list comprehensions processing large arrays (like 25,000 superheroes) is likely to be **10.0 MiB - 15.0 MiB** or **20.0 MiB - 30.0 MiB** depending on the actual data and calculations involved. 

Choose the option that best fits the profiling results.

Correct! Using a list comprehension approach allocates anywhere from 0.1 MiB to 5 MiB of memory to calculate your BMIs.

If you run %mprun multiple times within your session, you may notice that the Increment column reports 0.0 MiB for all lines of code. This is due to a limitation with the magic command. After running %mprun once, the memory allocation analyzed previously is taken into account for all consecutive runs and %mprun will start from the place the first run left off.

Now that we've profiled the calc_bmi_lists() function, let's see if you can do better with a different approach.
