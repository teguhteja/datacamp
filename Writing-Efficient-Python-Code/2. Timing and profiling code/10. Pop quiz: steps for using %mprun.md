Pop quiz: steps for using %mprun
Suppose you have a list of superheroes (named heroes) along with each hero's height (in centimeters) and weight (in kilograms) loaded as NumPy arrays (named hts and wts, respectively). You also have a convert_units() function saved in a file titled hero_funcs.py.

What are the necessary steps you need to take in order to profile the convert_units() function acting on your superheroes data if you'd like to see the line-by-line memory consumption of convert_units()?

Use the command from hero_funcs import convert_units to load the function you'd like to profile.
Press
1

Use %load_ext memory_profiler to load the memory_profiler within your IPython session.
Press
2

Use %mprun -f convert_units convert_units(heroes, hts, wts) to get line-by-line memory allocations.

To profile the `convert_units()` function for line-by-line memory consumption using `%mprun`, the necessary steps are as follows:

1. **Import the Function:**
   Use the command to load the function you'd like to profile:
   ```python
   from hero_funcs import convert_units
   ```

2. **Load the Memory Profiler:**
   Load the `memory_profiler` within your IPython session:
   ```python
   %load_ext memory_profiler
   ```

3. **Profile the Function:**
   Use `%mprun` with the `-f` flag to specify the function and pass the required arguments:
   ```python
   %mprun -f convert_units convert_units(heroes, hts, wts)
   ```

### Conclusion
The correct answer is:
- **All of the above.**

By completing all these steps, you will be able to effectively profile the memory usage of the `convert_units()` function.
