# Using %lprun: spot bottlenecks

Using %lprun: spot bottlenecks
Profiling a function allows you to dig deeper into the function's source code and potentially spot bottlenecks. When you see certain lines of code taking up the majority of the function's runtime, it is an indication that you may want to deploy a different, more efficient technique.

Lets dig deeper into the convert_units() function.

def convert_units(heroes, heights, weights):

    new_hts = [ht * 0.39370  for ht in heights]
    new_wts = [wt * 2.20462  for wt in weights]

    hero_data = {}

    for i,hero in enumerate(heroes):
        hero_data[hero] = (new_hts[i], new_wts[i])

    return hero_data
Load the line_profiler package into your IPython session. Then, use %lprun to profile the convert_units() function acting on your superheroes data. Remember to use the special syntax for working with %lprun (you'll have to provide a -f flag specifying the function you'd like to profile).

The convert_units() function, heroes list, hts array, and wts array have been loaded into your session. After you've finished coding, answer the following question:

What percentage of time is spent on the new_hts list comprehension line of code relative to the total amount of time spent in the convert_units() function?

51% - 100%




To profile the `convert_units()` function and determine the percentage of time spent on the `new_hts` list comprehension line relative to the total time spent in the function, follow these steps in your IPython session:

1. **Load the line_profiler package:**
   ```python
   %load_ext line_profiler
   ```

2. **Profile the `convert_units()` function:**
   Use the `%lprun` command with the `-f` flag to specify the function to profile. This command should be structured like this:
   ```python
   %lprun -f convert_units convert_units(heroes, hts, wts)
   ```

3. **Analyze the output:**
   After running the above command, you'll get a detailed output showing how much time was spent on each line of the `convert_units()` function. Look for the time taken by the `new_hts` list comprehension line:

   ```python
   new_hts = [ht * 0.39370 for ht in heights]
   ```

4. **Calculate the percentage:**
   - **Total Time**: Look for the total time spent in the function.
   - **Time on `new_hts`**: Find the time taken for the list comprehension.
   - Use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time on } new\_hts}{\text{Total Time}} \right) \times 100
     \]

### Possible Answers
Based on the profiling results, you can choose the correct answer:

- **0% - 10%**
- **11% - 20%**
- **21% - 50%** (X)
- **51% - 100%**

That's right! This seems like it may be a potential bottleneck in your function. Can you think of a way to make this more efficient? You'll explore a possible upgrade in the next exercise.

### Conclusion
After running the profiling and calculating the percentage, select the option that best represents the time spent on the `new_hts` line relative to the total runtime of the `convert_units()` function. The expected result might vary depending on the data and execution environment. If you find that the list comprehension takes a significant amount of time, you might consider optimizing that part of the code in the future.
