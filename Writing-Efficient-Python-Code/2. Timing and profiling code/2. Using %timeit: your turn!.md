# Using %timeit: your turn!

Using %timeit: your turn!
You'd like to create a list of integers from 0 to 50 using the range() function. However, you are unsure whether using list comprehension or unpacking the range object into a list is faster. Let's use %timeit to find the best implementation.

For your convenience, a reference table of time orders of magnitude is provided below (faster at the top).

symbol	name	unit (s)
ns	nanosecond	10-9
µs (us)	microsecond	10-6
ms	millisecond	10-3
s	second	100

Use list comprehension and range() to create a list of integers from 0 to 50 called nums_list_comp.

```py
# Create a list of integers (0-50) using list comprehension
nums_list_comp = [num for num in ____(____)]
print(nums_list_comp)

```
Here's how to complete the code using list comprehension with `range()`. We'll also use `%timeit` to measure its execution time and compare performance:

```python
# Create a list of integers (0-50) using list comprehension
nums_list_comp = [num for num in range(51)]
print(nums_list_comp)

# Measure the time taken to create the list using list comprehension
%timeit [num for num in range(51)]
```

Explanation:
- `range(51)` generates numbers from 0 to 50.
- `%timeit` will help determine the speed of this approach by running it multiple times and displaying the average time taken.

This provides an accurate measure for comparing list comprehension to other methods, like unpacking with `list(range(51))`.

Use range() to create a list of integers from 0 to 50 and unpack its contents into a list called nums_unpack.

```py
# Create a list of integers (0-50) using list comprehension
nums_list_comp = [num for num in range(51)]
print(nums_list_comp)

# Create a list of integers (0-50) by unpacking range
nums_unpack = [____(____)]
print(nums_unpack)

```

To create a list by unpacking the `range` object, simply pass `range(51)` to the `list()` function. Here’s the code:

```python
# Create a list of integers (0-50) using list comprehension
nums_list_comp = [num for num in range(51)]
print(nums_list_comp)

# Create a list of integers (0-50) by unpacking range
nums_unpack = list(range(51))
print(nums_unpack)
```

### Explanation:
- `list(range(51))` creates a list by unpacking each integer generated by `range(51)` directly into a list, making `nums_unpack` contain integers from 0 to 50.

3
Use %timeit within your IPython console (i.e. not within the script.py window) to compare the runtimes for creating a list of integers from 0 to 50 using list comprehension vs. unpacking the range object. Don't include the print() statements when timing.

Which method was faster?

Possible answers


List comprehension was faster than unpacking range().

Unpacking the range object was faster than list comprehension.

Both methods had the same runtime.

To compare the runtimes of both methods, you can use `%timeit` in your IPython console as follows:

1. For list comprehension:

   ```python
   %timeit [num for num in range(51)]
   ```

2. For unpacking the range object:

   ```python
   %timeit list(range(51))
   ```

### Expected Results
Typically, **unpacking the range object** (using `list(range(51))`) is faster than **list comprehension**. This is because list comprehension involves additional overhead from the loop operation, whereas `list(range(51))` is a direct transformation of the range into a list.

So, the correct answer is:

**"Unpacking the range object was faster than list comprehension."**
