# Pop quiz: steps for using %lprun

Pop quiz: steps for using %lprun
Below is the convert_units() function, which converts the heights and weights of our favorite superheroes from metric units to Imperial units.

def convert_units(heroes, heights, weights):

    new_hts = [ht * 0.39370  for ht in heights]
    new_wts = [wt * 2.20462  for wt in weights]

    hero_data = {}

    for i,hero in enumerate(heroes):
        hero_data[hero] = (new_hts[i], new_wts[i])

    return hero_data
Suppose you have a list of superheroes (named heroes) along with each hero's height (in centimeters) and weight (in kilograms) loaded as NumPy arrays (named hts and wts respectively).

What are the necessary steps you need to take in order to profile the convert_units() function acting on your superheroes data if you'd like to see line-by-line runtimes?

Use %load_ext line_profiler to load the line_profiler within your IPython session.
Press
1

Use %lprun -f convert_units convert_units(heroes, hts, wts) to get line-by-line runtimes.
Press
2

Use %timeit convert_units(heroes, hts, wts) to gather runtimes.
Press

The first and second options from above are necessary.

To profile the `convert_units()` function and see line-by-line runtimes using the line_profiler in an IPython session, you need to follow these steps:

1. Load the line_profiler extension.
2. Use the `%lprun` command to run the function with the necessary arguments.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Press 4: The first and second options from above are necessary.**

### Explanation of the Steps:

1. **Load the line_profiler:**
   ```python
   %load_ext line_profiler
   ```

2. **Profile the function:**
   ```python
   %lprun -f convert_units convert_units(heroes, hts, wts)
   ```

### Note:
- The third option using `%timeit` is not relevant for obtaining line-by-line runtimes; it gives overall execution time for the function but not detailed profiling.
