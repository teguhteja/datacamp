Change the value provided to the content argument to False.

Remove the content argument.

Change the value provide to the content argument to a string.

The correct way to fix the issue is to **remove the `content` argument**. The `requests.get()` function does not accept a `content` argument, so it needs to be removed from the function call.

Corrected code:

```python
requests.get(url="https://app.datacamp.com")
```

### Explanation:
- The `requests.get()` function has no `content` argument, and adding it will result in an error. Therefore, removing it is the correct solution.
