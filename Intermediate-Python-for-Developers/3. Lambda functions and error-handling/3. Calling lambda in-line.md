# Calling lambda in-line

Calling lambda in-line
Remember, one of the key benefits of lambda is the ability to use functions in-line.

In this exercise, you'll modify the approach of the previous exercise to add tax to the sales_price variable in-line without storing a lambda function as a variable first.

In a single line of code, make a lambda function that multiplies sale_price by 1.2 and returns the results.

sale_price = 29.99

# Call a lambda function adding 20% to sale_price
print(____)

To apply the lambda function to each value in the `sales_prices` list and add 20% tax, you can use the `map()` function, which applies a function to each item in an iterable. Here’s how you can achieve that:

```python
sales_prices = [29.99, 9.95, 14.50, 39.75, 60.00]

# Create add_taxes to add 20% to each item in sales_prices
add_taxes = map(lambda x: x * 1.2, sales_prices)

# Use add_taxes to return a new list with updated values
print(list(add_taxes))
```

### Explanation:
- The `map()` function is used to apply the lambda function to each element of the `sales_prices` list.
- The lambda function multiplies each price by 1.2 to add the 20% tax.
- `list()` is used to convert the `map` object back into a list, which is then printed.
