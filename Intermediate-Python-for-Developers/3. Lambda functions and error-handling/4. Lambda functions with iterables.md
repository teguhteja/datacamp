# Lambda functions with iterables

Lambda functions with iterables
You've used lambda functions to perform actions on a single value; now it's time to test yourself on working with iterables.

You've been provided with a list called sales_prices containing sales prices for several items. Your goal is to use a lambda function to add tax (20%) to each value in the list.

Instructions

Create add_taxes, which multiplies each value in sales_prices by 20%.
Print a list using add_taxes to update values in sales_prices.

To apply the lambda function to each value in the `sales_prices` list and add 20% tax, you can use the `map()` function, which applies a function to each item in an iterable. Hereâ€™s how you can achieve that:

```python
sales_prices = [29.99, 9.95, 14.50, 39.75, 60.00]

# Create add_taxes to add 20% to each item in sales_prices
add_taxes = map(lambda x: x * 1.2, sales_prices)

# Use add_taxes to return a new list with updated values
print(list(add_taxes))
```

### Explanation:
- The `map()` function is used to apply the lambda function to each element of the `sales_prices` list.
- The lambda function multiplies each price by 1.2 to add the 20% tax.
- `list()` is used to convert the `map` object back into a list, which is then printed.
