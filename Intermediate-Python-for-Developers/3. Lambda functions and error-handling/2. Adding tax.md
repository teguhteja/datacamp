Adding tax
Time to test out your lambda function skills!

In this exercise, you'll use a lambda function to add a tax of 20% to the cost of the sale_price variable.

Instructions

Define the add_tax lambda function to multiply the argument provided to it, x, by 1.2.
Call add_tax() on the sale_price variable.

sale_price = 29.99

# Define a lambda function called add_tax
add_tax = ____

# Call the lambda function
print(____(____))

Here’s how you can complete the exercise by defining the `add_tax` lambda function and applying it to the `sale_price` variable:

```python
sale_price = 29.99

# Define a lambda function called add_tax
add_tax = lambda x: x * 1.2

# Call the lambda function and print the result
print(add_tax(sale_price))
```

### Explanation:
- The lambda function `add_tax` multiplies its argument `x` by 1.2 (to add 20% tax).
- It is then called on the `sale_price` variable (which is `29.99`), and the result is printed.
