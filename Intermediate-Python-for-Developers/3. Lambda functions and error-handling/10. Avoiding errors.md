# Avoiding errors

Avoiding errors
In the video, you saw a couple of approaches for error handling that can be applied to custom functions.

In this exercise, you'll test out one of the approaches that avoids raising an error, printing a helpful message if an error occurs, but not terminating the script.

Use a keyword allowing you to attempt to run code that cleans text.
Swap a space for a single underscore in the text argument.
Use another keyword that prints a helpful message if an error occurs when calling the snake_case() function.


def snake_case(text):
  # Attempt to clean the text
  ____:
    # Swap spaces for underscores
    clean_text = ____.____("____", "____")
    clean_text = clean_text.lower()
  # Run this code if an error occurs
  ____:
    print("The snake_case() function expects a string as an argument, please check the data type provided.")
    
snake_case("User Name 187")


To handle potential errors gracefully without terminating the script, you can use a `try-except` block. Here's how you can implement it:

```python
def snake_case(text):
  # Attempt to clean the text
  try:
    # Swap spaces for underscores
    clean_text = text.replace(" ", "_")
    clean_text = clean_text.lower()
    print(clean_text)  # Print the cleaned text
  # Run this code if an error occurs
  except:
    print("The snake_case() function expects a string as an argument, please check the data type provided.")
    
snake_case("User Name 187")
```

### Explanation:
- The `try` block attempts to run the code that replaces spaces with underscores and converts the text to lowercase.
- The `except` block catches any errors (such as passing a non-string argument) and prints a helpful message without terminating the script.
