# Debugging code

Debugging code
Developers will inevitably produce errors when writing code—this is completely normal! The ability to read error messages and debug or fix your code is a crucial skill when building or maintaining software.

In this exercise, you have been provided with code that produces errors and will need to identify the cause so that you can resolve these issues.

Fix the code provided so that it creates and then prints the sales list without any errors.

# Define the sales list
sales = [125.97, 84.32, 99.78 154.21, 78.50, 83.67, 111.13]

# Print the sales list
print(sale)

To fix the code, you need to address two issues:
1. There's a missing comma between `99.78` and `154.21` in the `sales` list.
2. The variable `sales` is printed as `sale`, which should be corrected.

Here’s the corrected version of the code:

```python
# Define the sales list
sales = [125.97, 84.32, 99.78, 154.21, 78.50, 83.67, 111.13]

# Print the sales list
print(sales)
```

### Changes made:
1. Added the missing comma between `99.78` and `154.21`.
2. Changed `print(sale)` to `print(sales)` to correctly reference the variable.
