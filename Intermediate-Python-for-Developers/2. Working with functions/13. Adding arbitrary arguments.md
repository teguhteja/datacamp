# Adding arbitrary arguments

Adding arbitrary arguments
In the video, you saw that Python allows custom functions to accept any number of positional arguments through the use of "Arbitrary arguments". This flexibility enables functions to be used in a variety of ways while still producing the expected results!

Using this power, you'll build a function that concatenates (joins together) strings, regardless of how many blocks of text are provided!

Instructions

Define a function called concat() that accepts arbitrary arguments called args.
Create a variable called result and assign an empty string to it.
Use a for loop to iterate over each arg in args.
Call the function to test that it works correctly.

# Define a function called concat
____
  
  # Create an empty string
  result = ____
  
  # Iterate over the Python args tuple
  ____:
    result += " " + arg
  return result

# Call the function
print(____("Python", "is", "great!"))


Hereâ€™s how you can implement the `concat()` function with arbitrary arguments:

```python
# Define a function called concat
def concat(*args):
  
  # Create an empty string
  result = ""
  
  # Iterate over the Python args tuple
  for arg in args:
    result += " " + arg
  return result.strip()  # To remove the leading space

# Call the function
print(concat("Python", "is", "great!"))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Arbitrary Arguments (`*args`)**: The function accepts any number of arguments, which are collected into a tuple `args`.
2. **Empty String (`result`)**: We initialize an empty string `result` to store the concatenated result.
3. **Loop through `args`**: For each `arg` in `args`, it is added to `result` with a space before it.
4. **Return**: The `strip()` method is used to remove the leading space at the start of the string. 

### Output:
```python
Python is great!
```
