# Docstrings

1. Docstrings
00:00 - 00:00
Custom functions, when designed well, can be fairly intuitive. But it's great to make things easy for ourselves and others to understand how to use our functions. With that in mind, let's look at one more important element of custom functions: docstrings.

2. Docstrings
00:00 - 00:00
A docstring is a string, or block of text, used to describe what a function does. Docstrings are displayed, along with additional information, when we use the help function. Here, we see the docstring as part of the output of calling help on the round function. Docstrings are incredibly useful as they explain how to use functions.

3. Accessing a docstring
00:00 - 00:00
So, we can get information about a function, including its docstring, by calling help.

4. Accessing a docstring
00:00 - 00:00
However, if we just want the docstring, then we write the function name,

5. Accessing a docstring
00:00 - 00:00
add a dot,

6. Accessing a docstring
00:00 - 00:00
then two underscores.

7. Accessing a docstring
00:00 - 00:00
We then write doc, representing the docstring,

8. Accessing a docstring
00:00 - 00:00
and finish with two more underscores. Two sets of double underscores are referred to as "dunder" in programming. In this case, we access the "dunder-doc" attribute of the round function.

9. Accessing a docstring
00:00 - 00:00
The output shows the same information as the help function, except it has some strange characters, a backslash followed by "n". This is actually code representing a new line, which is why when we compare this to the output of help there are sentences split across separate lines.

10. Creating a docstring
00:00 - 00:00
Let's add a docstring to the average function that we created earlier. To add a docstring, we use triple quotation marks directly after defining the function. Here, we provide a brief description, which is known as a one-line docstring. Just like any other content within the function body, the docstring must be indented.

11. Accessing the docstring
00:00 - 00:00
We can display our docstring by accessing the function's dunder-doc attribute as we did before!

12. Updating a docstring
00:00 - 00:00
Because dunder-doc is an attribute of a function, we can modify a docstring by assigning a new value to it! Here, we assign average function's docstring to a new sentence.

13. Multi-line docstring
00:00 - 00:00
We can also use a multi-line docstring to provide more information, which is useful if the function is more complex or has lots of arguments.

14. Multi-line docstring
00:00 - 00:00
We keep the summary line at the start, leave a blank line, and then write Args, representing the function's arguments.

15. Multi-line docstring
00:00 - 00:00
We then indent the next line and write the argument name, put its data type in brackets, and add a brief description. We can repeat this if we have more arguments.

16. Multi-line docstring
00:00 - 00:00
We then write Returns, and again indent. Here, we describe the variable that is returned, including its data type.

17. Accessing the docstring
00:00 - 00:00
Calling help shows our full docstring including the blank line formatting.

18. Let's practice!
00:00 - 00:00
Let's add docstrings to some functions!
