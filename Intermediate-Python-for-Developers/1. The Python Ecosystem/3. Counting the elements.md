# Counting the elements

Counting the elements
In the video, you saw some of Python's most helpful built-in functions.

One of them can be used to count the number of elements in a variable. You'll see three variables in the following steps, one dictionary course_ratings, one list course_completions, and one string most_popular_course. You'll practice applying this function to the three variables!

1
Use a function to count the number of key-value pairs in course_ratings, storing as a variable called num_courses, then print the variable.
course_ratings = {"LLM Concepts": 4.7, 
                  "Introduction to Data Pipelines": 4.75, 
                  "AI Ethics": 4.62, 
                  "Introduction to dbt": 4.81}

# Print the number of key-value pairs
num_courses = len(course_ratings)
print(num_courses)


2
Use a function to count the number of courses in course_completions, storing as num_courses, and print this variable.

Here's how you can implement the function to count the number of courses in `course_completions` and print the result:

```python
course_completions = [97, 83, 121, 205, 56, 174, 92, 117, 164]

# Find the number of courses
num_courses = len(course_completions)

# Print the number of courses
print(num_courses)
```

### Explanation:
1. **`len(course_completions)`**: This function calculates the length of the `course_completions` list, which gives the total number of elements (courses) in the list.
2. **`print(num_courses)`**: This line outputs the total number of courses counted.

The `num_courses` variable will hold the count, and it will be printed as the result.

3
Use a function to count the number of characters in most_popular_course, storing as title_length, and print the variable.


Here's how you can count the number of characters in `most_popular_course` and print the result:

```python
most_popular_course = "Introduction to dbt"

# How many characters are in most_popular_course?
title_length = len(most_popular_course)

# Print the number of characters
print(title_length)
```

### Explanation:
1. **`len(most_popular_course)`**: This function counts the total number of characters in the string `most_popular_course`, including spaces.
2. **`print(title_length)`**: This line prints the variable `title_length`, which contains the character count.
