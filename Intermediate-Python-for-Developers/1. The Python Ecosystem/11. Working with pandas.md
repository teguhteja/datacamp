Create sales_df by using a pandas function to convert sales into a DataFrame.
Preview the first five rows of sales_df.

# Import pandas as pd
____ ____ ____ ____

# Convert sales to a pandas DataFrame
____ = ____.____()

#Â Preview the first five rows
print(____.____())

Here's how to complete the exercise by importing `pandas`, converting the `sales` dictionary to a DataFrame, and previewing the first five rows:

```python
# Import pandas as pd
import pandas as pd

# Convert sales to a pandas DataFrame
sales_df = pd.DataFrame(sales)

# Preview the first five rows
print(sales_df.head())
```

### Explanation:
- **`import pandas as pd`**: This imports the `pandas` module with the alias `pd`.
- **`pd.DataFrame(sales)`**: Converts the `sales` dictionary into a pandas DataFrame.
- **`sales_df.head()`**: Displays the first five rows of the DataFrame.
