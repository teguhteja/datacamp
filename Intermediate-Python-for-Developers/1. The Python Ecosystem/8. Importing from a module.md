# Importing from a module

Importing from a module
Another useful module is datetime, which allows you to create and work with dates and times, as well as time zones and time periods!

The datetime module has a function called date.

In this exercise, you'll practice importing and using the date method from the datetime module and use it to create a variable.

Instructions
100 XP
Import the date function from the datetime module.
Create a variable called deadline, assigning a call of date(), passing in the numbers 2024, 1, and 19, in that order, separated by commas.
Check the data type of deadline.
Print the deadline variable.

# Import date from the datetime module
____ ____ ____ ____

#Â Create a variable called deadline
deadline = ____(____, ____, ____)

# Check the data type
print(____(____))

# Print the deadline
print(____)

Here's how to complete the exercise to import the `date` function from the `datetime` module, create a variable, and check its data type:

```python
# Import date from the datetime module
from datetime import date

# Create a variable called deadline
deadline = date(2024, 1, 19)

# Check the data type
print(type(deadline))

# Print the deadline
print(deadline)
```

### Explanation:
- **`from datetime import date`**: This imports the `date` function from the `datetime` module.
- **`date(2024, 1, 19)`**: This creates a `date` object with the year 2024, the month of January, and the 19th day.
- **`type(deadline)`**: This checks and prints the data type of `deadline`, which will be `<class 'datetime.date'>`.
- **`print(deadline)`**: This will output the date `2024-01-19`.
