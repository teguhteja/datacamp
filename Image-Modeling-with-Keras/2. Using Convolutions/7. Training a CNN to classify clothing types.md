# Training a CNN to classify clothing types

Before training a neural network it needs to be compiled with the right cost function, using the right optimizer. During compilation, you can also define metrics that the network calculates and reports in every epoch. Model fitting requires a training data set, together with the training labels to the network.

The Conv2D model you built in the previous exercise is available in your workspace.

Instructions
100 XP
Compile the network using the 'adam' optimizer and the 'categorical_crossentropy' cost function. In the metrics list define that the network to report 'accuracy'.
Fit the network on train_data and train_labels. Train for 3 epochs with a batch size of 10 images. In training, set aside 20% of the data as a validation set, using the validation_split keyword argument.

```py
# Compile the model 
model.compile(optimizer=____, 
              loss=____, 
              metrics=[____])

# Fit the model on a training set
model.fit(____, ____, 
          validation_split=____, 
          epochs=____, batch_size=____)

```

To compile and fit your convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying clothing types, you can use the following code snippet. This code will set up the model to use the 'adam' optimizer and 'categorical_crossentropy' as the loss function, reporting accuracy as a metric during training.

### Completed Code

```python
# Compile the model 
model.compile(optimizer='adam', 
              loss='categorical_crossentropy', 
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Fit the model on a training set
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, 
          validation_split=0.2,  # 20% of the data will be used for validation
          epochs=3, 
          batch_size=10)  # Process 10 images at a time
```

### Explanation of Each Step

1. **Compile the Model**:
   - `optimizer='adam'`: The Adam optimizer is a popular choice for training neural networks because it combines the advantages of both Adagrad and RMSProp, adapting the learning rate for each parameter.
   - `loss='categorical_crossentropy'`: This loss function is suitable for multi-class classification problems where each label is one-hot encoded. It measures the dissimilarity between the predicted probability distribution and the true distribution.
   - `metrics=['accuracy']`: This specifies that you want to track the accuracy of the model during training and validation.

2. **Fit the Model**:
   - `train_data`: This is the dataset that will be used to train the model. It should be an array of images.
   - `train_labels`: These are the corresponding labels for the training data, typically one-hot encoded for multi-class classification.
   - `validation_split=0.2`: This indicates that 20% of the training data will be reserved for validation to evaluate the model's performance during training. This helps to monitor for overfitting.
   - `epochs=3`: The model will go through the entire training dataset three times.
   - `batch_size=10`: The model will process 10 images at a time in each training step.

This setup will allow you to train the CNN on your clothing dataset effectively. If you need further adjustments or explanations on any part, feel free to ask!
