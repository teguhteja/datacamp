# Image convolutions

Image convolutions
The convolution of an image with a kernel summarizes a part of the image as the sum of the multiplication of that part of the image with the kernel. In this exercise, you will write the code that executes a convolution of an image with a kernel using Numpy. Given a black and white image that is stored in the variable im, write the operations inside the loop that would execute the convolution with the provided kernel.

Select the right window from the image in each iteration and multiply this part of the image with the kernel.
Sum the result and allocate the sum to the correct entry in the output array (results).

```py
kernel = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]])
result = np.zeros(im.shape)

# Output array
for ii in range(im.shape[0] - 3):
    for jj in range(im.shape[1] - 3):
        result[ii, jj] = (____[ii:ii+3, jj:____+____] * ____).____

# Print result
print(result)

```

explain code 

```py
kernel = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]])
result = np.zeros(im.shape)

# Output array
for ii in range(im.shape[0] - 3):
    for jj in range(im.shape[1] - 3):
        result[ii, jj] = (im[ii:ii+3, jj:jj+3] * kernel).sum()

# Print result
print(result)

This code performs a 2D convolution on an image (`im`) using a 3x3 kernel. Below is a detailed explanation of each part:

### 1. **Kernel Definition:**
```py
kernel = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]])
```
- A 3x3 convolution kernel (or filter) is defined. This kernel is shaped like a "cross" where the center and the neighboring horizontal/vertical elements are set to `1`, while the diagonals are set to `0`. It will emphasize the central pixel and its direct neighbors when applied to an image.

### 2. **Result Array Initialization:**
```py
result = np.zeros(im.shape)
```
- The `result` array is initialized to be the same size as the image (`im`), filled with zeros. This array will store the output of the convolution after it is applied to each 3x3 window of the image.
- `im.shape` gives the dimensions (height and width) of the image.

### 3. **Loop for Convolution:**
```py
for ii in range(im.shape[0] - 3):
    for jj in range(im.shape[1] - 3):
        result[ii, jj] = (im[ii:ii+3, jj:jj+3] * kernel).sum()
```
This loop applies the convolution over each part of the image:

- **Outer Loop (`ii` loop):**
  - This iterates over the rows of the image. The range of `ii` is from `0` to `im.shape[0] - 3`, ensuring that the kernel (which has a height of 3) fits within the image boundaries.
  
- **Inner Loop (`jj` loop):**
  - This iterates over the columns of the image. Similarly, `jj` goes from `0` to `im.shape[1] - 3` to make sure the 3x3 kernel fits within the image width.

- **Convolution Operation:**
  ```py
  im[ii:ii+3, jj:jj+3] * kernel
  ```
  - For each pixel position `(ii, jj)`, a 3x3 window is extracted from the image using `im[ii:ii+3, jj:jj+3]`.
  - This window is multiplied element-wise with the `kernel`.
  
  ```py
  (im[ii:ii+3, jj:jj+3] * kernel).sum()
  ```
  - The result of the element-wise multiplication is summed, which produces a single scalar value that represents the filtered value for that window. This value is stored in `result[ii, jj]`.

### 4. **Printing the Result:**
```py
print(result)
```
- Finally, the `result` array, which contains the output of the convolution, is printed.

### Summary of Convolution:
The code applies the `3x3` kernel across the entire image, sliding it over every possible position, performing element-wise multiplication between the image window and the kernel, summing the values, and storing the result in the corresponding pixel location of the `result` array. The kernel "filters" the image based on the pattern of values in the kernel.
