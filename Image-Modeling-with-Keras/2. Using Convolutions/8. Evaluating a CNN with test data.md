# Evaluating a CNN with test data

Evaluating a CNN with test data
To evaluate a trained neural network, you should provide a separate testing data set of labeled images. The model you fit in the previous exercise is available in your workspace.

Instructions
100 XP
Evaluate the data on a separate test set: test_data and test_labels.
Use the same batch size that was used for fitting (10 images per batch).

# Evaluate the model on separate test data
____

To evaluate your trained convolutional neural network (CNN) using a separate test dataset, you can use the `evaluate` method provided by Keras. This method will allow you to assess the performance of the model on unseen data.

### Completed Code

Hereâ€™s how to evaluate the model on the test set:

```python
# Evaluate the model on separate test data
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels, batch_size=10)

# Print the evaluation results
print(f"Test Loss: {test_loss}")
print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy}")
```

### Explanation of Each Step

1. **Evaluate the Model**:
   - `model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels, batch_size=10)`: This method evaluates the model's performance on the test dataset.
     - `test_data`: This should be an array of test images.
     - `test_labels`: These are the corresponding labels for the test images, typically one-hot encoded.
     - `batch_size=10`: This is the same batch size used during training, allowing the model to process 10 images at a time.

2. **Return Values**:
   - The `evaluate` method returns two values: `test_loss` and `test_accuracy`. These values represent the loss and accuracy of the model on the test dataset.

3. **Print the Results**:
   - The final print statements output the test loss and accuracy to the console, providing a clear overview of how well the model performed on the test data.

### Conclusion
This code snippet will effectively assess the performance of your CNN model on the separate test dataset, giving you valuable insights into how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data. If you have any further questions or need more assistance, feel free to ask!
