# Add padding to a CNN

Add padding to a CNN
Padding allows a convolutional layer to retain the resolution of the input into this layer. This is done by adding zeros around the edges of the input image, so that the convolution kernel can overlap with the pixels on the edge of the image.

Instructions
100 XP
Add a Conv2D layer and choose a padding such that the output has the same size as the input.

```py
# Initialize the model
model = Sequential()

# Add the convolutional layer
model.add(____(10, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', 
                 input_shape=(img_rows, img_cols, 1), 
                 ____))

# Feed into output layer
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))


```


To ensure that the output of a convolutional layer has the same spatial dimensions as its input, you can use padding. In Keras, you can achieve this by setting the `padding` parameter to `'same'`. This method adds zeros around the edges of the input image, allowing the convolutional kernel to fully overlap with the edge pixels.

### Completed Code

Hereâ€™s how you can modify the code to add padding to the `Conv2D` layer:

```python
# Initialize the model
model = Sequential()

# Add the convolutional layer
model.add(Conv2D(10, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', 
                 input_shape=(img_rows, img_cols, 1), 
                 padding='same'))

# Feed into output layer
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **`padding='same'`**: This argument ensures that the output dimensions (height and width) of the convolutional layer match the input dimensions. When using a kernel size of 3x3, Keras will add a 1-pixel border of zeros around the input image.

### Summary

Adding padding is essential in convolutional neural networks, especially when you want to preserve the spatial dimensions of the input data. This can be particularly important in tasks where the input size needs to be consistent, such as in image classification.
