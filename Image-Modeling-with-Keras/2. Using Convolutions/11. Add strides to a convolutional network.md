# Add strides to a convolutional network

Add strides to a convolutional network
The size of the strides of the convolution kernel determines whether the kernel will skip over some of the pixels as it slides along the image. This affects the size of the output because when strides are larger than one, the kernel will be centered on only some of the pixels.

Construct a neural network with a Conv2D layer with strided convolutions that skips every other pixel.

```py
# Initialize the model
model = Sequential()

# Add the convolutional layer
model.add(Conv2D(10, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', 
              input_shape=(img_rows, img_cols, 1), 
              ____))

# Feed into output layer
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))

```

please explain 
```py
# Initialize the model
model = Sequential()

# Add a convolutional layer
model.add(Conv2D(10, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', 
                 input_shape=(img_rows, img_cols, 1), 
                 strides=2))

# Feed into output layer
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))
```

Certainly! Let's break down the provided code step by step. This code is used to build a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the Keras library for image classification tasks.

### 1. Initialize the Model
```python
model = Sequential()
```
- **`Sequential()`**: This initializes a linear stack of layers in Keras. It allows you to add layers one by one in the order they will be applied. This is suitable for most simple models where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor.

### 2. Add a Convolutional Layer
```python
model.add(Conv2D(10, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', 
                 input_shape=(img_rows, img_cols, 1), 
                 strides=2))
```
- **`Conv2D`**: This layer applies a 2D convolution operation to the input, which is especially useful for processing image data. 

#### Parameters Explained:
- **`10`**: This specifies the number of filters (also known as kernels) to be applied in this convolutional layer. Each filter will learn to detect different features from the input image (e.g., edges, textures).

- **`kernel_size=3`**: This defines the size of the filters as \(3 \times 3\). Each filter will slide over the input image in this dimension, performing convolution.

- **`activation='relu'`**: This specifies the activation function to be used after the convolution operation. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function replaces any negative values with zero, introducing non-linearity and helping the model learn complex patterns.

- **`input_shape=(img_rows, img_cols, 1)`**: This defines the shape of the input data to the model. 
  - `img_rows` and `img_cols` represent the height and width of the input images, respectively.
  - The `1` indicates that the input is a grayscale image (single channel). For colored images, this would typically be `3` (for RGB channels).

- **`strides=2`**: This specifies the stride of the convolution operation. A stride of `2` means that the convolutional filter will move two pixels at a time both horizontally and vertically, effectively skipping every other pixel. This reduces the spatial dimensions of the output.

### 3. Feed into Output Layer
```python
model.add(Flatten())
```
- **`Flatten()`**: This layer converts the multi-dimensional output from the convolutional layer into a one-dimensional vector. This step is necessary before connecting to a fully connected layer (Dense layer), as Dense layers expect input in a flat format.

### 4. Add a Dense Output Layer
```python
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))
```
- **`Dense(3)`**: This specifies a fully connected layer with `3` output neurons. The number of neurons corresponds to the number of categories the model is classifying (e.g., types of clothing in a fashion dataset).

- **`activation='softmax'`**: The softmax activation function is used here to convert the output logits into probabilities that sum up to 1. Each output neuron represents a category, and the softmax function ensures that the predicted probabilities for each class can be interpreted as likelihoods.

### Summary
Overall, this code constructs a simple CNN architecture with one convolutional layer that extracts features from images, followed by a flattening layer and a fully connected output layer that classifies the images into three categories based on the learned features. The architecture is suitable for basic image classification tasks, especially when the dataset is not overly complex.
