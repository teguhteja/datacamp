# Defining image convolution kernels

Defining image convolution kernels
In the previous exercise, you wrote code that performs a convolution given an image and a kernel. This code is now stored in a function called convolution() that takes two inputs: image and kernel and produces the convolved image. In this exercise, you will be asked to define the kernel that finds a particular feature in the image.

For example, the following kernel finds a vertical line in images:

np.array([[-1, 1, -1], 
          [-1, 1, -1], 
          [-1, 1, -1]])

Define a kernel that finds horizontal lines in images.

```py
kernel = np.array([[____, ____, ____], 
                   [____, ____, ____],
                   [____, ____, ____]])
                   
```

The kernel defined as 

```python
kernel = np.array([[-1, -1, -1], 
                   [ 1,  1,  1], 
                   [-1, -1, -1]])
```

is a convolution kernel used primarily for detecting horizontal edges or lines in images. Here’s a breakdown of its structure and how it functions:

### Kernel Structure:
- **Size**: This kernel is a **3x3 matrix**. Convolutional kernels are typically square matrices, and a 3x3 kernel means it looks at a 3-pixel wide by 3-pixel tall window of the image at a time.
- **Values**: The values in the kernel are arranged as follows:
  - The **first row** contains `[-1, -1, -1]`: This means that the kernel is sensitive to dark pixels above the center pixel.
  - The **second row** contains `[1, 1, 1]`: This row emphasizes the center pixel and gives it a positive value, indicating that it is sensitive to bright pixels in the center row.
  - The **third row** also contains `[-1, -1, -1]`: Similar to the first row, it reacts to dark pixels below the center pixel.

### Functionality:
1. **Edge Detection**: 
   - This kernel highlights horizontal edges in an image. When the kernel is convolved with the image:
     - If a pixel in the center of the kernel is bright and the pixels directly above and below it are dark, the result will be a strong positive response.
     - Conversely, if the center pixel is dark and the surrounding pixels are bright, the result will be a strong negative response.

2. **Directional Sensitivity**: 
   - The kernel is designed to respond to **vertical transitions** in pixel intensity. 
   - For example:
     - Bright to dark (light line on a dark background) will yield a high value.
     - Dark to bright (dark line on a light background) will yield a low value or negative value.

3. **Sum of Products**:
   - When convolved with an image, each pixel's value is computed by taking the dot product of the kernel and the corresponding 3x3 section of the image. The result gives a new pixel value that represents the presence of a horizontal edge at that position.

### Visual Example:
Consider an example of a 3x3 section of an image:

```
[ 255, 255, 255 ]  # Light (white)
[   0,   0,   0 ]  # Dark (black)
[ 255, 255, 255 ]  # Light (white)
```

When this section is convolved with the kernel:

- Top pixels are all `255` (light).
- Middle pixels are `0` (dark).
- Bottom pixels are all `255` (light).

Calculating the convolution will yield a positive value, indicating a strong horizontal edge.

### Conclusion:
The kernel effectively highlights horizontal lines by calculating the contrast between the center pixel and the pixels directly above and below it. It’s a useful tool in image processing for tasks like edge detection, which is a fundamental step in many computer vision applications.

Define a kernel that finds a light spot surrounded by dark pixels.

```py
kernel = np.array([[____, ____, ____], 
                   [____, ____, ____],
                   [____, ____, ____]])
```

To define a kernel that specifically detects a light spot represented by a bright pixel (with higher values, e.g., `1`) surrounded by dark pixels (with lower values, e.g., `-1`), you can create a kernel that emphasizes the bright center and negatively weights the surrounding pixels.

Here’s an example of such a kernel:

```python
kernel = np.array([[ -1, -1, -1], 
                   [ -1,  1, -1], 
                   [ -1, -1, -1]])
```

### Explanation of the Kernel:

- **Kernel Structure**:
  - The kernel is a **3x3 matrix** designed to detect a bright pixel (high value) surrounded by dark pixels (low values).
  
- **Values**:
  - The **center pixel** is `1`, which gives it a positive weight, meaning that it will amplify the signal of the bright pixel.
  - The **surrounding pixels** have a value of `-1`, which gives them negative weights, meaning they will diminish the total if they are bright, allowing the kernel to respond strongly when the center pixel is bright and the surrounding pixels are dark.

### Functionality:
1. **Detection of Light Spots**:
   - When this kernel is convolved with an image, it will yield a high value if there is a bright pixel in the center and dark pixels surrounding it.
   - For example, if the center pixel is `1` (bright) and all surrounding pixels are `-1` (dark), the kernel will effectively sum to a positive value.

2. **Sum of Products**:
   - As the kernel slides over the image, it multiplies each pixel in the 3x3 region by the corresponding kernel value and sums the results.
   - This means if the center pixel is bright (1) and all surrounding pixels are dark (-1), the result will reflect a strong presence of a light spot.

### Visual Example:
Consider the following 3x3 section of an image:

```
[ -1, -1, -1 ]  # Dark (low values)
[ -1,  1, -1 ]  # Bright (high value) - the light spot
[ -1, -1, -1 ]  # Dark (low values)
```

When this section is convolved with the kernel, the calculation would look like this:

1. **Multiply each corresponding value**:
   - \((-1) * (-1) + (-1) * (-1) + (-1) * (-1) + (-1) * (-1) + 1 * 1 + (-1) * (-1) + (-1) * (-1) + (-1) * (-1) + (-1) * (-1)\)
   - This will result in a positive value, indicating the presence of a light spot.

### Conclusion:
This kernel effectively highlights a light spot with a high pixel value surrounded by lower pixel values. It is useful in image processing for tasks such as feature detection, particularly in identifying points of interest within an image.


Define a kernel that finds a dark spot surrounded by bright pixels.


```py
kernel = np.array([[____, ____, ____], 
                   [____, ____, ____],
                   [____, ____, ____]])

```

To define a kernel that detects a dark spot (represented by lower pixel values, e.g., `-1`) surrounded by bright pixels (represented by higher pixel values, e.g., `1`), you can create a kernel that emphasizes the dark center while negatively weighting the bright surrounding pixels.

Here’s an example of such a kernel:

```python
kernel = np.array([[  1,  1,  1], 
                    [  1, -1,  1], 
                    [  1,  1,  1]])
```

### Explanation of the Kernel:

- **Kernel Structure**:
  - The kernel is a **3x3 matrix** designed to detect a dark pixel (low value) surrounded by bright pixels (high values).
  
- **Values**:
  - The **center pixel** is `-1`, which gives it a negative weight, indicating that it will diminish the overall sum if it is dark.
  - The **surrounding pixels** have a value of `1`, which gives them positive weights, meaning they will amplify the sum if they are bright.

### Functionality:
1. **Detection of Dark Spots**:
   - When this kernel is convolved with an image, it will yield a high value when there is a dark pixel in the center and bright pixels surrounding it.
   - For example, if the center pixel is `-1` (dark) and all surrounding pixels are `1` (bright), the result will be significantly positive.

2. **Sum of Products**:
   - As the kernel slides over the image, it multiplies each pixel in the 3x3 region by the corresponding kernel value and sums the results.
   - This means if the center pixel is dark (`-1`) and all surrounding pixels are bright (`1`), the result will reflect a strong presence of a dark spot.

### Visual Example:
Consider the following 3x3 section of an image:

```
[  1,  1,  1 ]  # Bright (high values)
[  1, -1,  1 ]  # Dark (low value) - the dark spot
[  1,  1,  1 ]  # Bright (high values)
```

When this section is convolved with the kernel, the calculation would look like this:

1. **Multiply each corresponding value**:
   - \( (1) * (1) + (1) * (1) + (1) * (1) + (1) * (1) + (-1) * (-1) + (1) * (1) + (1) * (1) + (1) * (1) + (1) * (1) \)
   - This will result in a high positive value, indicating the presence of a dark spot.

### Conclusion:
This kernel effectively highlights a dark spot surrounded by bright pixels by using a strong negative weight at the center and positive weights around it. It can be useful in image processing for tasks such as detecting features or abnormalities in images, particularly when identifying points of interest against a bright background.
