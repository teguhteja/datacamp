# Adding dropout to your network

Adding dropout to your network
Dropout is a form of regularization that removes a different random subset of the units in a layer in each round of training. In this exercise, we will add dropout to the convolutional neural network that we have used in previous exercises:

Convolution (15 units, kernel size 2, 'relu' activation)
Dropout (20%)
Convolution (5 units, kernel size 2, 'relu' activation)
Flatten
Dense (3 units, 'softmax' activation)
A Sequential model along with Dense, Conv2D, Flatten, and Dropout objects are available in your workspace.

Add dropout applied to the first layer with 20%.
Add a flattening layer.

# Add a convolutional layer
model.add(Conv2D(15, kernel_size=2, activation='relu', 
                 input_shape=(img_rows, img_cols, 1)))

# Add a dropout layer
____

# Add another convolutional layer
model.add(Conv2D(5, kernel_size=2, activation='relu'))

# Flatten and feed to output layer
____
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))


To add a dropout layer to your convolutional neural network in Keras, you will insert the `Dropout` layer after the first convolutional layer. Below is the complete code with the appropriate sections filled in:

```python
# Add a convolutional layer
model.add(Conv2D(15, kernel_size=2, activation='relu', 
                 input_shape=(img_rows, img_cols, 1)))

# Add a dropout layer with 20% rate
model.add(Dropout(0.2))

# Add another convolutional layer
model.add(Conv2D(5, kernel_size=2, activation='relu'))

# Flatten and feed to output layer
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Convolutional Layer**:
   - **`model.add(Conv2D(15, kernel_size=2, activation='relu', input_shape=(img_rows, img_cols, 1)))`**: This line adds a convolutional layer with 15 filters, a kernel size of 2, and ReLU activation. It expects input images of shape `(img_rows, img_cols, 1)`.

2. **Dropout Layer**:
   - **`model.add(Dropout(0.2))`**: This line adds a dropout layer with a dropout rate of 20%. During training, 20% of the units in the previous layer will be randomly set to zero at each update to prevent overfitting. This helps the model generalize better by ensuring that it does not rely too heavily on any single unit.

3. **Second Convolutional Layer**:
   - **`model.add(Conv2D(5, kernel_size=2, activation='relu'))`**: This line adds another convolutional layer with 5 filters and the same kernel size and activation function.

4. **Flatten Layer**:
   - **`model.add(Flatten())`**: This line flattens the output of the previous layer to prepare it for the fully connected (Dense) layer. It converts the multi-dimensional output into a one-dimensional vector.

5. **Dense Layer**:
   - **`model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))`**: Finally, this line adds a dense layer with 3 units and a softmax activation function, suitable for multi-class classification.

### Conclusion:
By adding dropout to your model, you can effectively reduce the risk of overfitting, especially when training on small datasets or complex models. Dropout is a simple yet powerful technique that can improve the robustness of your neural network.
