# Plot the learning curves

Plot the learning curves
During learning, the model will store the loss function evaluated in each epoch. Looking at the learning curves can tell us quite a bit about the learning process. In this exercise, you will plot the learning and validation loss curves for a model that you will train.

Instructions
100 XP
Fit the model to the training data (train_data).
Use a validation split of 20%, 3 epochs and batch size of 10.
Plot the training loss.
Plot the validation loss.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Train the model and store the training object
training = ____

# Extract the history from the training object
history = training.____

# Plot the training loss 
plt.plot(history[____])
# Plot the validation loss
plt.plot(history[____])

# Show the figure
plt.show()

```py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Train the model and store the training object
training = model.fit(train_data, train_labels, validation_split=0.2, epochs=3, batch_size=10)

# Extract the history from the training object
history = training.history

# Plot the training loss 
plt.plot(history['loss'])
# Plot the validation loss
plt.plot(history['val_loss'])

# Show the figure
plt.show()
```

Certainly! Letâ€™s break down the code snippet line by line to understand how it works in the context of training a deep learning model and visualizing the learning process with Matplotlib.

### Code Explanation:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
- **`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`**: This line imports the Matplotlib library's `pyplot` module, which provides a MATLAB-like interface for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is commonly used for plotting graphs and visualizing data.

```python
# Train the model and store the training object
training = model.fit(train_data, train_labels, validation_split=0.2, epochs=3, batch_size=10)
```
- **`model.fit(...)`**: This method trains the neural network model on the provided training data.
  - **`train_data`**: The input data used for training the model.
  - **`train_labels`**: The corresponding labels for the training data.
  - **`validation_split=0.2`**: This parameter specifies that 20% of the training data should be set aside for validation. This allows monitoring of the model's performance on unseen data during training.
  - **`epochs=3`**: The model will go through the entire training dataset three times.
  - **`batch_size=10`**: The model will be trained in batches of 10 samples at a time.
- **`training`**: The variable stores the return value of `model.fit()`, which is a History object containing details about the training process, including the loss and metrics for each epoch.

```python
# Extract the history from the training object
history = training.history
```
- **`history = training.history`**: This line retrieves the history dictionary from the training object. The `history` dictionary contains keys for various metrics, including:
  - **`'loss'`**: Training loss values at each epoch.
  - **`'val_loss'`**: Validation loss values at each epoch.
  - Other metrics if specified (e.g., accuracy).

```python
# Plot the training loss 
plt.plot(history['loss'])
```
- **`plt.plot(history['loss'])`**: This line plots the training loss values stored in the `'loss'` key of the `history` dictionary. The x-axis will represent the epoch number, while the y-axis will represent the training loss. This curve helps visualize how well the model learns from the training data over time.

```python
# Plot the validation loss
plt.plot(history['val_loss'])
```
- **`plt.plot(history['val_loss'])`**: This line plots the validation loss values stored in the `'val_loss'` key. Similar to the training loss, this curve allows you to see how the model's performance on validation data changes across epochs. Comparing training and validation loss helps assess if the model is overfitting or generalizing well.

```python
# Show the figure
plt.show()
```
- **`plt.show()`**: This command displays the plot containing both the training and validation loss curves. This allows you to visually inspect how the losses change over the epochs and analyze the training process.

### Conclusion:
This code snippet effectively trains a deep learning model, captures the training history, and visualizes the training and validation loss curves. By analyzing these curves, you can gain insights into the model's learning process, identify potential overfitting (where validation loss increases while training loss decreases), and make informed decisions about model adjustments or hyperparameter tuning.
