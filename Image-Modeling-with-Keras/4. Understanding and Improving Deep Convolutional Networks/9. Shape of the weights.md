# Shape of the weights

Shape of the weights
A Keras neural network stores its layers in a list called model.layers. For the convolutional layers, you can get the weights using the .get_weights() method. This returns a list, and the first item in this list is an array representing the weights of the convolutional kernels. If the shape of this array is (2, 2, 1, 5), what does the first number (2) represent?

There are 2 channels in black and white images.

The kernel size is 2 by 2.

The model used a convolutional unit with 2 dimensions.

There are 2 convolutional layers in the network

In the context of the shape of the weights array `(2, 2, 1, 5)` for a convolutional layer, the first number (2) represents:

**The kernel size is 2 by 2.**

### Explanation of the Weight Shape:
- The shape of the weights array for a convolutional layer typically follows the format `(height, width, input_channels, output_channels)`:
  - **Height (2)**: The height of the convolutional kernel (the first number).
  - **Width (2)**: The width of the convolutional kernel (the second number).
  - **Input Channels (1)**: This indicates how many input channels the layer has (for example, 1 for grayscale images).
  - **Output Channels (5)**: This represents the number of filters (or kernels) that the layer has, which corresponds to the number of output channels produced by the convolution.

Thus, the correct interpretation of the first number (2) is that it refers to the height of the kernel, not the kernel size or the number of channels in the image.
