# Using stored weights to predict in a test set


Using stored weights to predict in a test set
Model weights stored in an hdf5 file can be reused to populate an untrained model. Once the weights are loaded into this model, it behaves just like a model that has been trained to reach these weights. For example, you can use this model to make predictions from an unseen data set (e.g. test_data).

Instructions
100 XP
Load the weights from a file called 'weights.hdf5'.
Predict the classes of the first three images from test_data.

# Load the weights from file
model.____

# Predict from the first three images in the test data
____ 

To load model weights from an HDF5 file and use the model to make predictions on a test dataset, you can follow these instructions. Hereâ€™s how to complete the provided code:

```python
# Load the weights from file
model.load_weights('weights.hdf5')

# Predict from the first three images in the test data
predictions = model.predict(test_data[:3])
```

### Explanation:

1. **Load the Weights**:
   - **`model.load_weights('weights.hdf5')`**: This line loads the weights of the model from the specified HDF5 file (`weights.hdf5`). The model must be compiled and have the same architecture as the one that was used to create the weights; otherwise, loading the weights may fail.

2. **Predict from the Test Data**:
   - **`model.predict(test_data[:3])`**: This line uses the model to make predictions on the first three images in `test_data`. The `predict` method outputs the predicted class probabilities for each input. In this case, it will return an array with predictions for the first three images.

### Additional Notes:
- After obtaining the predictions, you may want to interpret them, especially if you're dealing with a classification problem. For instance, if you have a multi-class classification scenario, you might need to use `np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)` to get the predicted class labels.
- Ensure that the `test_data` is preprocessed in the same way as the training data (e.g., normalization, reshaping) to ensure accurate predictions.

### Example of Getting Class Labels:
If you want to convert the predicted probabilities into class labels, you can add the following line:

```python
# Convert probabilities to class labels
predicted_classes = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)
```

This way, you can easily see which classes the model has predicted for the first three images in your test dataset.
