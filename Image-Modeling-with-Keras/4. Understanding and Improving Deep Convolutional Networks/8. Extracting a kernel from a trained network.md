# Extracting a kernel from a trained network

Extracting a kernel from a trained network
One way to interpret models is to examine the properties of the kernels in the convolutional layers. In this exercise, you will extract one of the kernels from a convolutional neural network with weights that you saved in a hdf5 file.

Instructions
100 XP
Load the weights into the model from the file weights.hdf5.
Get the first convolutional layer in the model from the layers attribute.
Use the .get_weights() method to extract the weights from this layer.

# Load the weights into the model
model.____('weights.hdf5')

# Get the first convolutional layer from the model
c1 = model.____[0]

# Get the weights of the first convolutional layer
weights1 = c1.____()

# Pull out the first channel of the first kernel in the first layer
kernel = weights1[0][...,0, 0]
print(kernel)

To extract a kernel from a trained convolutional neural network, you will need to load the model weights and access the specific convolutional layer. Below is the complete code with the appropriate sections filled in:

```python
# Load the weights into the model
model.load_weights('weights.hdf5')

# Get the first convolutional layer from the model
c1 = model.layers[0]

# Get the weights of the first convolutional layer
weights1 = c1.get_weights()

# Pull out the first channel of the first kernel in the first layer
kernel = weights1[0][..., 0, 0]
print(kernel)
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Load Weights**:
   - **`model.load_weights('weights.hdf5')`**: This line loads the weights of the model from the specified HDF5 file. The model must be defined with the same architecture as when the weights were saved.

2. **Access First Convolutional Layer**:
   - **`c1 = model.layers[0]`**: This line retrieves the first layer of the model, which is assumed to be a convolutional layer.

3. **Get Weights**:
   - **`weights1 = c1.get_weights()`**: This line calls the `get_weights()` method on the convolutional layer to extract the weights. The returned value is a list containing the weights and biases of the layer. Typically, the first element in this list is the kernel weights.

4. **Extract Kernel**:
   - **`kernel = weights1[0][..., 0, 0]`**: This line extracts the first channel of the first kernel from the first layer. The shape of the kernel weights is usually `(height, width, input_channels, output_channels)`. Here, we are using the ellipsis (`...`) to indicate that we want all elements along the height and width dimensions while selecting the first kernel (first output channel) and the first input channel.

5. **Print Kernel**:
   - **`print(kernel)`**: This line prints the extracted kernel, allowing you to analyze its values.

### Conclusion:
By extracting and inspecting the kernel weights from a convolutional layer, you can gain insights into what features the model has learned to recognize during training. This can be useful for understanding the behavior of your model and for debugging purposes.
