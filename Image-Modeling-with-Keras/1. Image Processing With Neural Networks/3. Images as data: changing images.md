# Images as data: changing images

Images as data: changing images
To modify an image, you can modify the existing numbers in the array. In a color image, you can change the values in one of the color channels without affecting the other colors, by indexing on the last dimension of the array.

The image you imported in the previous exercise is available in data.

Modify the bricks image to replace the top left corner of the image (10 by 10 pixels) into a red square.
Visualize the resulting image.

# Set the red channel in this part of the image to 1
data[____] = ____

# Set the green channel in this part of the image to 0
data[____] = ____

# Set the blue channel in this part of the image to 0
data[____] = ____

# Visualize the result

To modify the top-left corner of the image and replace it with a red square, you need to adjust the RGB channels. The red channel should be set to `1`, while the green and blue channels should be set to `0` to get a red color. Here's the code to achieve that:

```python
# Set the red channel in the top-left corner (10x10 pixels) to 1
data[0:10, 0:10, 0] = 1  # Red channel

# Set the green channel in the top-left corner (10x10 pixels) to 0
data[0:10, 0:10, 1] = 0  # Green channel

# Set the blue channel in the top-left corner (10x10 pixels) to 0
data[0:10, 0:10, 2] = 0  # Blue channel

# Visualize the result
plt.imshow(data)
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:
- `data[0:10, 0:10, 0] = 1`: This selects the red channel in the top-left corner (10x10 pixels) and sets it to `1` (full red).
- `data[0:10, 0:10, 1] = 0`: This selects the green channel in the same region and sets it to `0`.
- `data[0:10, 0:10, 2] = 0`: This selects the blue channel in the same region and sets it to `0`.
- Finally, `plt.imshow(data)` and `plt.show()` are used to display the modified image.
