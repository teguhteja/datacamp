# Compile a neural network

Compile a neural network
Once you have constructed a model in Keras, the model needs to be compiled before you can fit it to data. This means that you need to specify the optimizer that will be used to fit the model and the loss function that will be used in optimization. Optionally, you can also specify a list of metrics that the model will keep track of. For example, if you want to know the classification accuracy, you will provide the list ['accuracy'] to the metrics keyword argument.

Write code to compile the model with the 'adam' optimizer and 'categorical_crossentropy' as the loss function.

# Compile the model
model.____(optimizer=____, 
           loss=____, 
           metrics=['accuracy'])

To compile the neural network model in Keras, you'll specify the optimizer, the loss function, and the metrics. Here's how to complete the code for compiling the model using the `'adam'` optimizer and `'categorical_crossentropy'` as the loss function:

### Code:

```python
# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', 
              loss='categorical_crossentropy', 
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### Explanation:

1. **`optimizer='adam'`**: 
   - The Adam optimizer is a popular and efficient optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of both the `AdaGrad` and `RMSProp` optimizers.
   
2. **`loss='categorical_crossentropy'`**: 
   - This is the appropriate loss function when dealing with multi-class classification problems with one-hot encoded labels. It calculates the difference between the true labels and the predicted labels.
   
3. **`metrics=['accuracy']`**: 
   - This tells Keras to track the accuracy of the model during training and evaluation, allowing you to see how well the model is performing in terms of correct classifications.

Once compiled, the model is ready to be trained on your data!
