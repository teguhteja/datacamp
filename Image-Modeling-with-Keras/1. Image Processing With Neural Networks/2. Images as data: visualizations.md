# Images as data: visualizations

Images as data: visualizations
To display image data, you will rely on Python's Matplotlib library, and specifically use matplotlib's pyplot sub-module, that contains many plotting commands. Some of these commands allow you to display the content of images stored in arrays.

Import the image from the file bricks.png into data.
Display the image in data on the screen.

# Import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the image
data = plt.____('bricks.png')

# Display the image
plt.____(____)
plt.show()

To display an image using Matplotlib, you can use the `imread()` function to load the image and `imshow()` to display it. Here's how you can modify the code to display the image correctly:

```python
# Import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the image
data = plt.imread('bricks.png')

# Display the image
plt.imshow(data)
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:
- `plt.imread('bricks.png')`: This function reads the image from the file and loads it into the `data` variable as an array.
- `plt.imshow(data)`: This function displays the image stored in `data`.
- `plt.show()`: This function renders the image on the screen.

This should correctly display the image from the `bricks.png` file.
