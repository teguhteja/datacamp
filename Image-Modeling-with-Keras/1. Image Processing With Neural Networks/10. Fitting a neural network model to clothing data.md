# Fitting a neural network model to clothing data

Fitting a neural network model to clothing data
In this exercise, you will fit the fully connected neural network that you constructed in the previous exercise to image data. The training data is provided as two variables: train_data that contains the pixel data for 50 images of the three clothing classes and train_labels, which contains one-hot encoded representations of the labels for each one of these 50 images. Transform the data into the network's expected input and then fit the model on training data and training labels.

The model you compiled in the previous exercise, and train_data and train_labels are available in your workspace.

Prepare the data for fitting by reshaping it.
Fit the model by passing the input training data and training labels to the model's .fit() method.

# Reshape the data to two-dimensional array
train_data = train_data.reshape(____, ____)

# Fit the model
model.fit(____, ____, validation_split=0.2, epochs=3)

To fit a neural network model to the clothing data, you need to ensure that the training data is in the expected shape and format for the neural network. The `train_data` should be reshaped into a two-dimensional array where each row corresponds to a flattened image, and the labels are already in one-hot encoded format.

### Code:

```python
# Reshape the data to two-dimensional array (50 samples, 784 pixels per image)
train_data = train_data.reshape(50, 784)

# Fit the model
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, validation_split=0.2, epochs=3)
```

### Explanation:

1. **`train_data.reshape(50, 784)`**:
   - The `train_data` has 50 images, each represented by a 28x28 pixel grid (784 pixels total). 
   - Reshape the data so that each image becomes a one-dimensional array of 784 pixels, making it suitable for feeding into the neural network.

2. **`model.fit()`**:
   - **`train_data`**: The reshaped image data.
   - **`train_labels`**: The corresponding one-hot encoded labels for each image.
   - **`validation_split=0.2`**: This will use 20% of the training data as validation data to track model performance on unseen data during training.
   - **`epochs=3`**: The number of times the model will be trained on the entire dataset.

After running this code, the model will begin training for 3 epochs, and you'll be able to observe the training and validation accuracy over time.
