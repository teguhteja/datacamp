# Build a neural network

Build a neural network
We will use the Keras library to create neural networks and to train these neural networks to classify images. These models will all be of the Sequential type, meaning that the outputs of one layer are provided as inputs only to the next layer.

In this exercise, you will create a neural network with Dense layers, meaning that each unit in each layer is connected to all of the units in the previous layer. For example, each unit in the first layer is connected to all of the pixels in the input images. The Dense layer object receives as arguments the number of units in that layer, and the activation function for the units. For the first layer in the network, it also receives an input_shape keyword argument.

This course touches on a lot of concepts you may have forgotten, so if you ever need a quick refresher, download the Keras Cheat Sheet and keep it handy!

The first layer receives images as input, has 10 units and 'relu' activation.
The second input layer has 10 units and 'relu' activation.
The output layer has one unit for each category (3 categories) and 'softmax' activation.

# Imports components from Keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# Initializes a sequential model
model = Sequential()

# First layer
model.add(____(10, activation=____, input_shape=(784,)))

# Second layer
model.add(____(____, activation=____))

# Output layer
____

To build a neural network using Keras, the model needs to be defined layer by layer using the `Sequential` model. In this case, we are creating a neural network with two hidden layers and an output layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification (3 categories). Here's how you can fill in the blanks:

### Code:

```python
# Imports components from Keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# Initializes a sequential model
model = Sequential()

# First layer with 10 units, 'relu' activation, and input shape of 784 (e.g., 28x28 pixel images)
model.add(Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)))

# Second layer with 10 units and 'relu' activation
model.add(Dense(10, activation='relu'))

# Output layer with 3 units (one for each category) and 'softmax' activation
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))
```

### Explanation:

1. **First Layer**:
   - **`Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,))`**: 
     - 10 units (neurons) in this layer.
     - **`'relu'`** is the activation function, which stands for Rectified Linear Unit.
     - **`input_shape=(784,)`** defines the shape of the input, where `784` is the total number of pixels for each flattened image (28x28 pixels).
   
2. **Second Layer**:
   - **`Dense(10, activation='relu')`**: 
     - 10 units in this layer as well, with `'relu'` activation.
   
3. **Output Layer**:
   - **`Dense(3, activation='softmax')`**: 
     - The output layer has 3 units, one for each category in your classification problem (e.g., shirt, dress, shoe).
     - **`'softmax'`** activation ensures that the output will be a probability distribution over the 3 classes.

This neural network is now ready to be compiled and trained on your dataset!
