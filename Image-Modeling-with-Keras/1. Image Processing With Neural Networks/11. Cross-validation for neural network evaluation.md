# Cross-validation for neural network evaluation

Cross-validation for neural network evaluation
To evaluate the model, we use a separate test data-set. As in the train data, the images in the test data also need to be reshaped before they can be provided to the fully-connected network because the network expects one column per pixel in the input.

The model you fit in the previous exercise, and test_data and test_labels are available in your workspace.

Reshape the test_data so that it can be used to evaluate the model.
Evaluate the model on test_data using test_labels.

# Reshape test data
test_data = test_data.____(____, ____)

# Evaluate the model
model.evaluate(____, ____)


The error message indicates that you're trying to reshape an array of size 7840 into a shape of (50, 784). However, reshaping is only possible if the total number of elements in the array remains the same before and after the reshape.

To troubleshoot this issue, let’s determine the current shape of `test_data`. Here’s how you can check that and then reshape it correctly:

### Steps to Fix the Issue

1. **Check the Current Shape**:
   Before reshaping, print the shape of `test_data` to understand its current dimensions.

   ```python
   print(test_data.shape)
   ```

2. **Determine the Correct Shape**:
   If the shape shows that there are, for example, 7840 elements in total, it might mean there are 10 images (since \( 7840 \div 784 = 10 \)). Hence, you should reshape it based on the number of images you have.

   To reshape correctly:
   - If you have 10 images, you should reshape like this:
     ```python
     test_data = test_data.reshape(10, 784)
     ```
   - If you have a different number of images, adjust accordingly. For instance, if the shape is (N, 784) where N is the number of images, you can reshape it as:
     ```python
     test_data = test_data.reshape(-1, 784)  # Automatically infers the number of images
     ```

3. **Evaluate the Model**:
   After correctly reshaping `test_data`, you can then evaluate the model:
   ```python
   model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels)
   ```

### Example Code with Shape Check

Here’s a complete code snippet that incorporates these suggestions:

```python
# Check the current shape of test_data
print("Original shape of test_data:", test_data.shape)

# Reshape test data
test_data = test_data.reshape(-1, 784)  # This will infer the number of samples automatically

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels)
print(f"Loss: {loss}, Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

### Conclusion
Using `-1` in the reshape method allows NumPy to automatically calculate the required dimension based on the total size of the array, which prevents reshape-related errors. This should resolve the issue you're encountering.
