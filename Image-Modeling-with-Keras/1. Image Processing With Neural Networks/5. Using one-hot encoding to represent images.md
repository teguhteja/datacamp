# Using one-hot encoding to represent images

Using one-hot encoding to represent images
Neural networks expect the labels of classes in a dataset to be organized in a one-hot encoded manner: each row in the array contains zeros in all columns, except the column corresponding to a unique label, which is set to 1.

The fashion dataset contains three categories:

Shirts
Dresses
Shoes
In this exercise, you will create a one-hot encoding of a small sample of these labels.

Instructions
100 XP
Initialize the ohe_labels variable to hold the one-hot encoded array.
Use np.where() to find the location of the category of the item in each iteration in categories.
Assign a 1 into the correct row/column combination in every iteration.

# The number of image categories
n_categories = 3

# The unique values of categories in the data
categories = np.array(["shirt", "dress", "shoe"])

# Initialize ohe_labels as all zeros
ohe_labels = ____((len(labels), n_categories))

# Loop over the labels
for ii in range(len(labels)):
    # Find the location of this label in the categories variable
    jj = np.where(___)
    # Set the corresponding zero to one
    ohe_labels[____] = ____


explain

```py
# The number of image categories
n_categories = 3

# The unique values of categories in the data
categories = np.array(["shirt", "dress", "shoe"])

# Initialize ohe_labels as all zeros
ohe_labels = np.zeros((len(labels), n_categories))

# Loop over the labels
for ii in range(len(labels)):
    # Find the location of this label in the categories variable
    jj = np.where(categories == labels[ii])
    # Set the corresponding zero to one
    ohe_labels[ii, jj] = 1
```

Here's an explanation of the code snippet step by step:

### 1. Number of Categories:
```py
n_categories = 3
```
- This defines the total number of categories or classes in your dataset (e.g., `"shirt"`, `"dress"`, and `"shoe"`).
  
### 2. Categories Array:
```py
categories = np.array(["shirt", "dress", "shoe"])
```
- This is an array that holds the unique class labels (`"shirt"`, `"dress"`, `"shoe"`) for reference. These labels represent the different categories of the images you are working with.

### 3. Initialize `ohe_labels`:
```py
ohe_labels = np.zeros((len(labels), n_categories))
```
- **`np.zeros()`** creates an array of zeros.
- The shape of the array is `(len(labels), n_categories)`, meaning:
  - `len(labels)` gives the number of items (e.g., images) to encode.
  - `n_categories` is the number of categories (3 in this case: shirt, dress, shoe).
  
The result is a 2D array (`ohe_labels`) where each row represents a label (image category), and each column corresponds to one of the categories. Initially, all elements are `0`.

### 4. Loop Over Labels:
```py
for ii in range(len(labels)):
```
- A loop that iterates over each item in the `labels` array. `ii` represents the index of each label (or image) in the array.

### 5. Find Location of Label in Categories:
```py
jj = np.where(categories == labels[ii])
```
- **`np.where()`** is used to find the index where the current label (`labels[ii]`) matches a value in the `categories` array.
  - For example, if `labels[ii] == "shirt"`, `jj` will be the index where `"shirt"` is located in the `categories` array.
  - If `"shirt"` is at index `0`, `jj` will be `0`.

### 6. Set the One-Hot Value:
```py
ohe_labels[ii, jj] = 1
```
- This sets the element in `ohe_labels` corresponding to the label at position `ii` to `1` in the appropriate column `jj` (the position in the `categories` array).
  - For example, if `labels[ii] == "shirt"`, `jj` will be `0`. So, the first column in row `ii` will be set to `1`, indicating the label `"shirt"`.

### Overall Effect:
- The code loops through each label, finds its position in the `categories` array, and sets the corresponding entry in the `ohe_labels` array to `1`, effectively creating a **one-hot encoded** representation of the labels.

#### Example:

If the `labels` array contains `["shirt", "shoe", "dress"]`, the output of the one-hot encoding will be:

```bash
[
 [1, 0, 0],  # "shirt"
 [0, 0, 1],  # "shoe"
 [0, 1, 0]   # "dress"
]
```

This representation is useful for training machine learning models where the labels are categorical but need to be represented as binary arrays.
