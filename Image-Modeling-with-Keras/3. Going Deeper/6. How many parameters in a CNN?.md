# How many parameters in a CNN?

How many parameters in a CNN?
We need to know how many parameters a CNN has, so we can adjust the model architecture, to reduce this number or shift parameters from one part of the network to another. How many parameters would a network have if its inputs are images with 28-by-28 pixels, there is one convolutional layer with 10 units kernels of 3-by-3 pixels, using zero padding (input has the same size as the output), and one densely connected layer with 2 units?

To calculate the number of parameters in the given CNN, let's break it down:

### Convolutional Layer:
- **Input size**: 28x28 pixels, 1 channel (since it's not mentioned, we assume grayscale images).
- **Convolutional layer**: 10 filters (units) with a kernel size of 3x3.
- **Padding**: Zero padding, so the output has the same size as the input, i.e., 28x28.
  
For each filter in the convolutional layer:
- Each filter has 3x3 parameters (weights) and 1 bias.
- Total parameters per filter = \( (3 \times 3) + 1 = 10 \) parameters.
- Since there are 10 filters, the total parameters for the convolutional layer = \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \) parameters.

### Dense Layer:
- The output of the convolutional layer is a 28x28x10 feature map (28x28 spatial dimensions with 10 channels).
- Before feeding into the dense layer, we flatten the feature map: 28x28x10 = 7,840 units.
- The dense layer has 2 units, so the number of parameters is:
  - \( 7,840 \times 2 \) (weights) + 2 biases = 15,682 parameters.

### Total Parameters:
- Convolutional layer: 100 parameters.
- Dense layer: 15,682 parameters.

Thus, the total number of parameters is:
\[ 100 + 15,682 = 15,782 \]

### The correct answer is **15,782**.
