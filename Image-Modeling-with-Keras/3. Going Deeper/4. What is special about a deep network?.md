What is special about a deep network?
Networks with more convolution layers are called "deep" networks, and they may have more power to fit complex data, because of their ability to create hierarchical representations of the data that they fit.

What is a major difference between a deep CNN and a CNN with only one convolutional layer?

The correct answer is:

**2. A deep network requires more data and more computation to fit.**

Deep networks with more convolutional layers can capture more complex patterns and hierarchical features, but they also require more data and computational resources to be trained effectively compared to networks with only one convolutional layer.
