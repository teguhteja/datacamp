# EmailOperator and dependencies

EmailOperator and dependencies
Now that you've successfully defined the PythonOperators for your workflow, your manager would like to receive a copy of the parsed JSON file via email when the workflow completes. The previous tasks are still defined and the DAG process_sales_dag is configured. Please note that this task uses the older DAG definition method and is added for you.

Import the class to send emails.
Define the Operator and add the appropriate arguments (to, subject, files).
Set the task order so the tasks run sequentially (Pull the file, parse the file, then email your manager).

# Import the Operator
from ____ import ____

# Define the task
email_manager_task = ____(
    task_id='email_manager',
    ____='manager@datacamp.com',
    ____='Latest sales JSON',
    html_content='Attached is the latest sales JSON file as requested.',
    ____='parsedfile.json',
    dag=process_sales_dag
)

# Set the order of tasks
pull_file_task ____ parse_file_task ____ email_manager_task


```py
# Import the Operator
from airflow.operators.email import EmailOperator

# Define the task
email_manager_task = EmailOperator(
    task_id='email_manager',
    to='manager@datacamp.com',
    subject='Latest sales JSON',
    html_content='Attached is the latest sales JSON file as requested.',
    files='parsedfile.json',
    dag=process_sales_dag
)

# Set the order of tasks
pull_file_task >> parse_file_task >> email_manager_task
```

Here's how to use the `EmailOperator` to send an email with the parsed JSON file attached, and set the task order:

```python
# Import the Operator
from airflow.operators.email import EmailOperator

# Define the task
email_manager_task = EmailOperator(
    task_id='email_manager',
    to='manager@datacamp.com',
    subject='Latest sales JSON',
    html_content='Attached is the latest sales JSON file as requested.',
    files=['parsedfile.json'],
    dag=process_sales_dag
)

# Set the order of tasks
pull_file_task >> parse_file_task >> email_manager_task
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing**: The `EmailOperator` is imported from `airflow.operators.email`.
2. **Task Definition**: The `email_manager_task` is defined with the following parameters:
   - `to`: The recipient's email address.
   - `subject`: The subject line of the email.
   - `html_content`: The body content of the email.
   - `files`: The attachment (the parsed JSON file).
   - `dag`: The DAG to which the task belongs.
3. **Task Ordering**: Using the bitshift operator (`>>`), the tasks are ordered as:
   - `pull_file_task` runs first.
   - `parse_file_task` runs after that.
   - Finally, `email_manager_task` runs after the file is parsed.

This setup ensures that the file is pulled, parsed, and then emailed in sequence.
