# Troubleshooting DAG dependencies

Troubleshooting DAG dependencies
You've created a DAG with intended dependencies based on your workflow but for some reason Airflow won't load / execute the DAG. Try using the terminal to:

Run the airflow dags command to see all subcommands available. Look for a subcommand to read errors and run it.
Decipher the error message.
Use cat workspace/dags/codependent.py to view the Python code.
Determine which of the following lines should be removed from the Python code.

task1 >> task2

task2 >> task3

task3 >> task1

In the DAG dependencies you mentioned, there is a circular dependency:

```python
task1 >> task2
task2 >> task3
task3 >> task1
```

### Issue Explanation
- The line `task3 >> task1` creates a circular dependency, meaning the tasks would form a never-ending loop. In Airflow, DAGs must have a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, which means there should be no cycles or circular dependencies.

### Solution
You need to **remove** the line that creates the circular dependency:

```python
task3 >> task1  # This line should be removed
```

### Steps to Troubleshoot:
1. **Check Available Commands**: Use the terminal command to view all Airflow subcommands:
   ```bash
   airflow dags --help
   ```
2. **Read DAG Errors**: Use the appropriate subcommand to inspect errors:
   ```bash
   airflow dags trigger --help  # Check for options or run `airflow dags list`
   airflow dags list-import-errors
   ```
3. **View Python Code**: Use `cat` to display the DAG code and identify problematic lines:
   ```bash
   cat workspace/dags/codependent.py
   ```

By removing the line `task3 >> task1`, your DAG should no longer have a circular dependency and should load correctly in Airflow.
