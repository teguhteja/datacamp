# Troubleshooting DAG runs

Troubleshooting DAG runs
You've scheduled a DAG called process_sales which is set to run on the first day of the month and email your manager a copy of the report generated in the workflow. The start_date for the DAG is set to February 15, 2023. Unfortunately it's now March 2nd and your manager did not receive the report and would like to know what happened.

Use the information you've learned about Airflow scheduling to determine what the issue is.

⚠️ NOTE! If you see the error DAG 'process_sales' seems to be missing from DagBag, try refreshing the page.

The `schedule_interval` has not yet passed since the `start_date`.

The `email_manager_task` is not downstream of the other tasks.

The DAG run has an error.

The `op_kwargs` are incorrect for the `EmailOperator`.

Based on the issue you're describing, here are the potential reasons for the problem with your `process_sales` DAG not running properly:

### 1. **The `schedule_interval` has not yet passed since the `start_date`.**
   - **Explanation**: If your DAG is scheduled to run on the first day of the month, and the `start_date` is set to February 15, 2023, the first scheduled run would be on March 1, 2023 (or March 2, if you run the DAG on the 2nd). 
   - **Possible Issue**: If the `start_date` was set to February 15 and the `schedule_interval` is incorrect (not aligned with the first of the month), the DAG might not run as expected.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that the `schedule_interval` for the DAG is properly set to `'0 0 1 * *'` for the first day of every month. Check the `start_date` and adjust it to align with the correct scheduling.

   ```python
   dag = DAG(
       'process_sales',
       default_args=default_args,
       schedule_interval='0 0 1 * *',  # Run on the first day of every month
       start_date=datetime(2023, 2, 1)  # Start date aligned to the first of the month
   )
   ```

### 2. **The `email_manager_task` is not downstream of the other tasks.**
   - **Explanation**: In an Airflow DAG, tasks need to be defined in a specific order with dependencies. If `email_manager_task` is not downstream of the other tasks, it will not execute after the data processing tasks.
   - **Possible Issue**: The `email_manager_task` should depend on the previous tasks in the DAG, meaning it should be set to run after they complete.
   - **Solution**: Make sure you add the correct task dependencies using the `>>` operator (or `set_downstream`).

   ```python
   # Ensure email_manager_task is downstream of the previous tasks
   task1 >> task2 >> email_manager_task
   ```

### 3. **The DAG run has an error.**
   - **Explanation**: There could be a failure during one of the tasks that causes the DAG to fail and prevent subsequent tasks from running.
   - **Possible Issue**: If there's an error during the execution of any task, such as the file not being pulled or parsed correctly, the DAG run will fail.
   - **Solution**: Check the Airflow UI for the specific error message. Inspect the logs of each task to identify any errors that might have occurred during execution. Resolve those errors and re-trigger the DAG if necessary.

### 4. **The `op_kwargs` are incorrect for the `EmailOperator`.**
   - **Explanation**: If the arguments for the `EmailOperator` are incorrect, such as providing wrong file paths or email addresses, it may cause the task to fail.
   - **Possible Issue**: Incorrect arguments (e.g., wrong `files` or missing `to` fields) could prevent the email from being sent.
   - **Solution**: Double-check that the `EmailOperator` has the correct arguments. For example, verify the file path, recipient email, and other fields.

   ```python
   email_manager_task = EmailOperator(
       task_id='email_manager',
       to='manager@datacamp.com',
       subject='Sales Report',
       html_content='Attached is the latest sales report.',
       files=['path/to/sales_report.json'],  # Correct file path
       dag=process_sales_dag
   )
   ```

### Conclusion:
- **Check the DAG's `schedule_interval` and `start_date`** to ensure it's aligned with the first of the month and hasn't skipped the scheduled run.
- **Verify the task dependencies** to ensure that `email_manager_task` is downstream of the other tasks.
- **Check for errors in the DAG run logs** to identify potential issues with task execution.
- **Ensure the `EmailOperator` has correct arguments**, such as the recipient email and attachment path.

These steps should help you identify and resolve the issue with the `process_sales` DAG.
