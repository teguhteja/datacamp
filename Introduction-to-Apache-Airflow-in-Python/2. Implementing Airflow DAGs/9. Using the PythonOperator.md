# Using the PythonOperator

Using the PythonOperator
You've implemented several Airflow tasks using the BashOperator but realize that a couple of specific tasks would be better implemented using Python. You'll implement a task to download and save a file to the system within Airflow.

The requests library is imported for you, and the DAG process_sales_dag is already defined.

Define a function called pull_file with two parameters, URL and savepath.
Use the print() function and Python f-strings to write a message to the logs.
# Define the method
def ____(____, ____):
    r = requests.get(URL)
    with open(savepath, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(r.content)    
    # Use the print method for logging
    print(f"File pulled from {____} and saved to {____}")

Here's how to define the `pull_file` function to use with the PythonOperator:

### Step 1: Define the Function
```python
# Define the method
def pull_file(URL, savepath):
    # Make a GET request to the URL
    r = requests.get(URL)
    # Write the content to the specified file path
    with open(savepath, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(r.content)    
    # Use the print method for logging
    print(f"File pulled from {URL} and saved to {savepath}")
```

### Explanation:
1. The function `pull_file` takes two parameters: `URL` (the source of the file) and `savepath` (where the file will be saved).
2. The `requests.get(URL)` method is used to pull the file from the internet.
3. The `with open(savepath, 'wb')` writes the content in binary mode to the given path.
4. `print()` is used to log a message, making debugging easier.

2
Import the necessary object to use the Python Operator.
def pull_file(URL, savepath):
    r = requests.get(URL)
    with open(savepath, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(r.content)   
    # Use the print method for logging
    print(f"File pulled from {URL} and saved to {savepath}")
    
# Import the PythonOperator class
from ____ import ____
To import the necessary object for using the PythonOperator, you should import it as follows:

```python
# Import the PythonOperator class
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
```

This import will allow you to use the `PythonOperator` to define tasks in your Airflow DAG.

3
Create a new task assigned to the variable pull_file_task, with the id pull_file.
Add the pull_file(URL, savepath) function defined previously to the operator.
Define the arguments needed for the task.

def pull_file(URL, savepath):
    r = requests.get(URL)
    with open(savepath, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(r.content)   
    # Use the print method for logging
    print(f"File pulled from {URL} and saved to {savepath}")

from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator

# Create the task
pull_file_task = ____(
    ____='pull_file',
    # Add the callable
    python_callable=____,
    # Define the arguments
    ____={'URL':'http://dataserver/sales.json', '____':'latestsales.json'}
)

Here's how you can create the `pull_file_task` using the `PythonOperator`:

```python
# Create the task
pull_file_task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='pull_file',
    # Add the callable
    python_callable=pull_file,
    # Define the arguments
    op_kwargs={'URL': 'http://dataserver/sales.json', 'savepath': 'latestsales.json'}
)
```

### Explanation:
1. **`task_id`**: Assigns an ID to the task, in this case, `'pull_file'`.
2. **`python_callable`**: Specifies the function to be called, which is `pull_file`.
3. **`op_kwargs`**: Passes the arguments to the `pull_file` function using a dictionary. The `URL` and `savepath` are defined as key-value pairs.
