Executor implications
You're learning quite a bit about running Airflow DAGs and are gaining some confidence at developing new workflows. That said, your manager has mentioned that on some days, the workflows are taking a lot longer to finish and asks you to investigate. She also mentions that the salesdata_ready.csv file is taking longer to generate these days and the time of day it is completed is variable.

This exercise requires information from the previous two lessons - remember the implications of the available arguments and modify the workflow accordingly. Note that for this exercise, you're expected to modify one line of code, not add any extra code.

Determine the level of parallelism available on this system. You can do this by checking the airflow configuration (you can run airflow info in the terminal).
Look at the source for the DAG file and fix which entry is causing the problem.

```py
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from airflow.sensors.filesystem import FileSensor
from datetime import datetime

report_dag = DAG(
    dag_id = 'execute_report',
    schedule_interval = "0 0 * * *"
)

precheck = FileSensor(
    task_id='check_for_datafile',
    filepath='salesdata_ready.csv',
    start_date=datetime(2024,1,20),
    mode='poke',
    dag=report_dag
)

generate_report_task = BashOperator(
    task_id='generate_report',
    bash_command='generate_report.sh',
    start_date=datetime(2024,1,20),
    dag=report_dag
)

precheck >> generate_report_task

```

You're correct. The type of executor in Airflow plays a crucial role in determining the level of parallelism, which affects how many tasks can run simultaneously. From the `airflow info` output provided, we see that your setup uses the **`SequentialExecutor`**.

### Understanding the Implications of `SequentialExecutor`
- **`SequentialExecutor`**: This executor can run only **one task at a time**. It is mainly used for local development, testing, or environments where resource constraints are significant.
- Because `SequentialExecutor` only supports one task running at a time, parallelism is not possible in this setup.

### Fix for the Scheduling Problem
To reduce inefficiencies, especially in a `SequentialExecutor` setup, you should use `mode='reschedule'` for your `FileSensor`. This mode is more efficient because it does not occupy a task slot while waiting for the file, which is important when only one task can run at a time.

### Updated Code for Efficiency
Here's how you can modify the `FileSensor` to use `reschedule` mode:



```python
precheck = FileSensor(
    task_id='check_for_datafile',
    filepath='salesdata_ready.csv',
    start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 20),
    mode='reschedule',  # Use 'reschedule' to free up the task slot
    poke_interval=300,  # Check every 5 minutes
    timeout=18000,  # Timeout after 5 hours
    dag=report_dag
)
```

### Why Use `mode='reschedule'`?
- **Efficient Resource Use**: In `reschedule` mode, the sensor task does not hold onto a task slot while waiting, which is critical when parallelism is limited.
- **Reduced Load**: This helps prevent your Airflow instance from being overloaded, especially when using `SequentialExecutor`.

By using `reschedule` mode and adjusting the `poke_interval`, you ensure your Airflow setup runs efficiently, even with the constraints of `SequentialExecutor`.
