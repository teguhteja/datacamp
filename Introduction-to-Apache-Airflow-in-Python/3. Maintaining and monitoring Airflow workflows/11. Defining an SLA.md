# Defining an SLA

Defining an SLA
You've successfully implemented several Airflow workflows into production, but you don't currently have any method of determining if a workflow takes too long to run. After consulting with your manager and your team, you decide to implement an SLA at the DAG level on a test workflow.

All appropriate Airflow libraries have been imported for you.

Import the timedelta object.
Define a sla of 30 minutes.
Add the SLA to the DAG.

```py
# Import the timedelta object
____

# Create the dictionary entry
default_args = {
  'start_date': datetime(2024, 1, 20),
  '____': ____
}

# Add to the DAG
test_dag = DAG('test_workflow', default_args=____, schedule_interval=None)


```

To define an SLA (Service Level Agreement) for your DAG in Apache Airflow, you'll need to import `timedelta` from the `datetime` module, set the `sla` in the `default_args`, and then add it to the DAG definition. Here's how you can do it:

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Import the `timedelta` object**: This is required to specify the SLA time as a duration.
2. **Define the SLA**: Set the SLA value to `30 minutes` using `timedelta`.
3. **Add the SLA to `default_args`**: This will ensure that the SLA is considered for the tasks in the DAG.
4. **Attach `default_args` to the DAG**: Ensure the DAG uses the `default_args` with the SLA configuration.

### Corrected Code:

```python
from datetime import timedelta, datetime

# Create the dictionary entry
default_args = {
  'start_date': datetime(2024, 1, 20),
  'sla': timedelta(minutes=30)  # Define the SLA as 30 minutes
}

# Add to the DAG
test_dag = DAG('test_workflow', default_args=default_args, schedule_interval=None)
```

### Explanation:
- **Import `timedelta`**: This is used to define the duration of the SLA (in this case, 30 minutes).
- **`sla`**: The SLA is set as `timedelta(minutes=30)`, which means that each task in the DAG should complete within 30 minutes.
- **Attach `default_args`**: The `default_args` containing the SLA is passed to the DAG to ensure that the SLA is applied to all tasks in the DAG.

Now, if a task exceeds the defined SLA (30 minutes in this case), Airflow will log an alert and mark the task as missed.
