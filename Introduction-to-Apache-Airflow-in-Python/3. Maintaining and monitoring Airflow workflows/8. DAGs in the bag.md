DAGs in the bag
You've taken over managing an Airflow cluster that you did not setup and are trying to learn a bit more about the system. Which of the following is true?

Instructions

The DAG is scheduled for hourly processing.

The Airflow user does not have proper permissions.

The `dags_folder` is set to `/home/repl/workspace/dags`.

Based on the information provided, the correct statement is:

- **The `dags_folder` is set to `/home/repl/workspace/dags`.**

### Explanation
- The **`dags_folder`** is indeed set to `/home/repl/workspace/dags`, as seen from the output of the `airflow info` command.
- There is no information given about the scheduling interval being hourly, so we cannot assume that.
- There's also no information provided regarding the permissions of the Airflow user, so we cannot confirm if they are improper or not.

Therefore, the only verifiable statement is about the `dags_folder` location.
