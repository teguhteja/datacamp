# Generate and email a report

Generate and email a report
Airflow provides the ability to automate almost any style of workflow. You would like to receive a report from Airflow when tasks complete without requiring constant monitoring of the UI or log files. You decide to use the email functionality within Airflow to provide this message.

All the typical Airflow components have been imported for you, and a DAG is already defined as report_dag.

Define the proper operator for the email_report task.
Fill the missing details for the Operator. Use the file named monthly_report.pdf.
Set the email_report task to occur after the generate_report task.

# Define the email task
email_report = ____(
        task_id='email_report',
        to='airflow@datacamp.com',
        subject='Airflow Monthly Report',
        html_content="""Attached is your monthly workflow report - please refer to it for more detail""",
        files=[____],
        ____=report_dag
)

# Set the email task to run after the report is generated
email_report ____ generate_report

```py
# Define the email task
email_report = EmailOperator(
        task_id='email_report',
        to='airflow@datacamp.com',
        subject='Airflow Monthly Report',
        html_content="""Attached is your monthly workflow report - please refer to it for more detail""",
        files=['monthly_report.pdf'],
        dag=report_dag
)

# Set the email task to run after the report is generated
email_report << generate_report

```

Let me break down the code for you and explain each part:

### 1. **Defining the email task using `EmailOperator`:**

```python
email_report = EmailOperator(
    task_id='email_report',
    to='airflow@datacamp.com',
    subject='Airflow Monthly Report',
    html_content="""Attached is your monthly workflow report - please refer to it for more detail""",
    files=['monthly_report.pdf'],
    dag=report_dag
)
```

- **`task_id='email_report'`**: This is the unique identifier for the task in Airflow. Every task in a DAG must have a `task_id` to distinguish it from other tasks.
  
- **`to='airflow@datacamp.com'`**: The recipient email address. The email will be sent to this address when the task is executed.

- **`subject='Airflow Monthly Report'`**: The subject line of the email.

- **`html_content="""Attached is your monthly workflow report - please refer to it for more detail"""`**: This is the HTML content of the email body. It explains the purpose of the email and provides a message to the recipient.

- **`files=['monthly_report.pdf']`**: This is a list of files to be attached to the email. In this case, the file `monthly_report.pdf` will be attached. You must ensure that the file is in the correct path or location where Airflow can access it.

- **`dag=report_dag`**: This assigns the task (`email_report`) to a specific DAG (`report_dag`). Every task in Airflow must be associated with a DAG to be executed.

### 2. **Setting the task order using `<<` operator:**

```python
email_report << generate_report
```

- **`email_report << generate_report`**: This is a task dependency setting in Airflow. The `<<` operator is used to set the order in which tasks should run.
  
  - This means that **`generate_report`** will run **after** **`email_report`** completes.
  - Essentially, this line is saying that the task `email_report` (sending the email) should execute **first**, and only after it completes successfully, the task `generate_report` (generating the report) should run.

The other way around would be to use `>>`, which sets the opposite order:
- `email_report >> generate_report` would mean that `email_report` will run **before** `generate_report`.

### Summary:
1. **Define the `email_report` task**: It sends an email with a PDF attachment (`monthly_report.pdf`) to the specified recipient when triggered.
2. **Set task order with `<<`**: `email_report << generate_report` means `email_report` must complete before `generate_report` starts, ensuring that the email is sent first.

In the context of your DAG, this ensures that an email with the report is sent to the recipient before generating the actual report (`generate_report`).
