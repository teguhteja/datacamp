# Determining the executor

Determining the executor
While developing your DAGs in Airflow, you realize you're not certain the configuration of the system. Using the commands you've learned, determine which of the following statements is true.

Instructions
50XP

This system can run 12 tasks at the same time.

This system can run one task at a time. (X)

This system can run as many tasks as needed at a time.

To determine how many tasks your system can run simultaneously in Airflow, you need to check the configuration of the executor and any associated settings, like `parallelism` and `max_active_tasks_per_dag`.

### Steps to Check Airflow Executor Configuration
1. **Check the Airflow Configuration File**:
   - Locate your `airflow.cfg` file. This file contains settings for your Airflow environment.
   - Search for the `executor` setting to see what type of executor your system is using (e.g., `SequentialExecutor`, `LocalExecutor`, `CeleryExecutor`).

2. **Check Specific Settings**:
   - **Parallelism**: This parameter defines the maximum number of tasks that can run concurrently.
     ```bash
     airflow config get-value core parallelism
     ```
   - **Executor Type**:
     ```bash
     airflow config get-value core executor
     ```
   - **Max Active Tasks per DAG**:
     ```bash
     airflow config get-value core max_active_tasks_per_dag
     ```

### Determining the True Statement:
1. **If the system uses `SequentialExecutor`**:
   - It can only run **one task at a time**. This is suitable for simple or local setups.

2. **If the system uses `LocalExecutor`**:
   - It can run a specific number of tasks simultaneously, typically determined by the `parallelism` setting. For example, if `parallelism` is set to 12, then it can run **12 tasks at the same time**.

3. **If the system uses `CeleryExecutor` or `KubernetesExecutor`**:
   - It can run **as many tasks as needed**, depending on the resources available in the distributed environment.

### Conclusion:
- **Based on the settings you find** in `airflow.cfg`, you can determine which of the three statements is true. Check the `executor` type and `parallelism` to make an accurate assessment.
