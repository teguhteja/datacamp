# Sensory deprivation

Sensory deprivation
You've recently taken over for another Airflow developer and are trying to learn about the various workflows defined within the system. You come across a DAG that you can't seem to make run properly using any of the normal tools. Try exploring the DAG for any information about what it might be looking for before continuing.

The DAG is waiting for the file salesdata_ready.csv to be present.

The DAG expects a response from the SimpleHttpOperator before starting.

part1 needs a dependency added.

Here's a breakdown to address the situation:

### Understanding and Troubleshooting the DAG

1. **Identify Missing File Requirement**:
   - The DAG requires the presence of the file `salesdata_ready.csv` before it can proceed. Ensure this file is available in the correct directory or path specified by the DAG. You can verify this by checking the `FileSensor` or equivalent mechanism that monitors this file.

2. **Check for HTTP Response Requirement**:
   - The DAG relies on the `SimpleHttpOperator` to receive a response from an HTTP request. Make sure the HTTP endpoint is accessible and returning the expected response. The URL and expected response are likely defined within the operator. You might need to:
     - Check the configuration of the `SimpleHttpOperator`.
     - Ensure any API keys or authentication details are properly set up.

3. **Add Missing Dependency to `part1`**:
   - If `part1` needs a dependency added, determine what task should precede it. In Airflow, you can add a dependency using the `>>` or `<<` operators. For example:
     ```python
     part1_task >> part2_task  # This sets part2_task to run after part1_task.
     ```
   - Review the logical flow of the tasks to identify the correct dependencies.

### Next Steps:
- **Double-check** the configuration files for environment variables or parameters.
- **Run a test**: Once dependencies and requirements are verified, try running the DAG in a test environment.

This approach should help in getting the DAG to run successfully.
