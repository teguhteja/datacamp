# Examining DAGs with the Airflow UI

Examining DAGs with the Airflow UI
You've become familiar with the basics of an Airflow DAG and the basics of interacting with Airflow on the command-line. Your boss would like you to show others on your team how to examine any available DAGs. In this instance, she would like to know which operator is NOT in use with the DAG called update_state, as your team is trying to verify the components used in production workflows.

Remember that the Airflow UI allows various methods to view the state of DAGs. The Tree View lists the tasks and any ordering between them in a tree structure, with the ability to compress / expand the nodes. The Graph View shows any tasks and their dependencies in a graph structure, along with the ability to access further details about task runs. The Code view provides full access to the Python code that makes up the DAG.

Remember to select the operator NOT used in this DAG.

⚠️ NOTE! If you see the error DAG 'update_state' seems to be missing from DagBag, try refreshing the page.

To identify which operator is **NOT** used in the `update_state` DAG, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Airflow UI** and go to the **DAGs** page.
2. **Search for `update_state`** in the list of DAGs.
3. Click on the DAG name to open its details.
4. **Check the "Graph View"**: This view will show the tasks and their dependencies. Hover over each task to see which operator is being used.
5. **Check the "Code View"**: If needed, you can view the DAG's code to directly see which operators are imported and used in the workflow.

### Operators in Question:
- **BashOperator**: Used for executing bash commands.
- **PythonOperator**: Used for running Python functions.
- **JdbcOperator**: Not a default operator in Airflow (could be a custom operator or plugin). If it's not imported or used in the code, it's likely the one not used.
- **SimpleHttpOperator**: Used for making HTTP requests.

### Likely Answer:
The **`JdbcOperator`** is likely **NOT** used in the `update_state` DAG since it is not a default operator in Airflow and might require custom configuration.

You can confirm this by checking the DAG code and the views in the Airflow UI.
