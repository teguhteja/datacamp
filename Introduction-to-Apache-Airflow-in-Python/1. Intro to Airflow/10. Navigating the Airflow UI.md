cli_scheduler

cli_webserver

cli_worker

To identify which events have not run on your Airflow instance, you can navigate to the **"Logs"** or **"Admin"** sections of the Airflow UI to check for any entries related to these events. Typically:

- **`cli_scheduler`**: Refers to the scheduler service, which runs tasks based on DAG definitions.
- **`cli_webserver`**: Refers to the webserver that hosts the Airflow UI.
- **`cli_worker`**: Refers to a worker process that executes tasks.

Based on common setups:
- If the Airflow instance is running in a basic setup without distributed workers, then **`cli_worker`** might be the event that has not run.

However, to know for sure, you would need to check your Airflow instance logs for these specific entries.
