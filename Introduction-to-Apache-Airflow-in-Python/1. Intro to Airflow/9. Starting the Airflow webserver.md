# Starting the Airflow webserver

Starting the Airflow webserver
You've successfully created some DAGs within Airflow using the command-line tools, but notice that it can be a bit tricky to handle scheduling / troubleshooting / etc. After reading the documentation further, you realize that you'd like to access the Airflow web interface. For security reasons, you'd like to start the webserver on port 9090.

Which airflow command would you use to start the webserver on port 9090?

Airflow is installed and accessible from the command line. Remember to use the airflow -h command if needed. airflow <subcommand> -h will provide further detail. Note that there may already be a webserver running - you can ignore any error messages you see while searching for the correct command.
