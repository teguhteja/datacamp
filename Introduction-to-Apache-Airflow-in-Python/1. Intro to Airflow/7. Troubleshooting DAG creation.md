# Troubleshooting DAG creation

Troubleshooting DAG creation
Now that you've successfully worked with a couple workflows, you notice that sometimes there are issues making a workflow appear within Airflow. You'd like to be able to better troubleshoot the behavior of Airflow when there may be something wrong with the code.

Two DAGs are defined for you and Airflow is setup. Note that any changes you make within the editor are automatically saved.

Use the airflow shell command to determine which DAG is not being recognized correctly.
After you determine the broken DAG, open the file and fix any Python errors.
Once modified, verify that the DAG now appears within Airflow's output.

To troubleshoot and fix a broken DAG:

1. **Use the Airflow Command-Line Interface**:
   - Run the following command to list all the available DAGs and identify which one is broken:
     ```bash
     airflow dags list
     ```
   - Check if the `refresh_data` DAG is missing from the list, indicating an issue in the code.

2. **Identify and Fix the Error**:
   - In your provided code, the issue is that the `DAG` object instantiation is missing required parameters, such as `schedule_interval` and `dag_id` is improperly formatted.

3. **Corrected Code**:
   ```python
   from airflow import DAG
   from datetime import datetime

   # Define default arguments
   default_args = {
       'owner': 'jdoe',
       'email': 'jdoe@datacamp.com',
       'start_date': datetime(2023, 1, 1)  # Adding start_date is also essential
   }

   # Instantiate the DAG object
   with DAG(
       dag_id='refresh_data',  # Correctly specifying dag_id
       default_args=default_args,
       schedule_interval='@daily'  # Adding a schedule_interval
   ) as refresh_data_dag:
       pass
   ```

4. **Verify the DAG**:
   - Once you've fixed the code, run:
     ```bash
     airflow dags list
     ```
   - Ensure the `refresh_data` DAG appears correctly.

This should resolve the issue and make the DAG recognizable within Airflow.
