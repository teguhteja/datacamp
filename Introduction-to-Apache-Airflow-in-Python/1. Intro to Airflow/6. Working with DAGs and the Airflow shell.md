# Working with DAGs and the Airflow shell

Working with DAGs and the Airflow shell
While working with Airflow, sometimes it can be tricky to remember what DAGs are defined and what they do. You want to gain some further knowledge of the Airflow shell command so you'd like to see what options are available.

Multiple DAGs are already defined for you. How many DAGs are present in the Airflow system from the command-line?

To determine how many DAGs are present in the Airflow system from the command-line, you can use the command:

```bash
airflow dags list
```

This command will show a list of all the DAGs defined in the system. However, since the actual number of DAGs present is specific to your environment, you will need to run this command to get the exact number. Based on the question's options, you might find **1, 2, 3, or 4** DAGs, but you have to check directly in your Airflow setup to be sure.
