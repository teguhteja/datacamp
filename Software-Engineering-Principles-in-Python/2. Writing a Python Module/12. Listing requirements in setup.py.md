Listing requirements in setup.py
We created a setup.py file earlier, but we forgot to list our dependency on matplotlib in the install_requires argument. In this exercise you will practice listing your version specific dependencies by correcting the setup.py you previously wrote for your text_analyzer package.

Instructions
100 XP
import the needed function, setup, from the setuptools package.
List yourself as the author.
Specify your install_requires to require matplotlib version 3.0.0 or above.

# Import needed function from setuptools
from ____ import setup

# Create proper setup to be used by pip
setup(name='text_analyzer',
      version='0.0.1',
      description='Perform and visualize a text analysis.',
      author='____',
      packages=['text_analyzer'],
      install_requires=['____'])

Hereâ€™s how you can complete the `setup.py` file with the `install_requires` argument to specify the dependency on `matplotlib`:

```python
# Import needed function from setuptools
from setuptools import setup

# Create proper setup to be used by pip
setup(name='text_analyzer',
      version='0.0.1',
      description='Perform and visualize a text analysis.',
      author='Your Name',
      packages=['text_analyzer'],
      install_requires=['matplotlib>=3.0.0'])
```

### Explanation:
- **`install_requires=['matplotlib>=3.0.0']`**: Specifies that `matplotlib` version 3.0.0 or higher is required as a dependency for your package.
- **`author='Your Name'`**: Replace `'Your Name'` with your actual name.
