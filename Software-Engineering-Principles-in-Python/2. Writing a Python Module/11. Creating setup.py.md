import the needed function, setup, from the setuptools package.
Complete the name & packages arguments; keep in mind your package is located in a directory named text_analyzer.
List yourself as the author.


# Import needed function from setuptools
from ____ import ____

# Create proper setup to be used by pip
setup(name='____',
      version='0.0.1',
      description='Perform and visualize a text analysis.',
      author='____',
      packages=['____'])


Hereâ€™s how you can complete the `setup.py` file for your `text_analyzer` package:

```python
# Import needed function from setuptools
from setuptools import setup

# Create proper setup to be used by pip
setup(name='text_analyzer',
      version='0.0.1',
      description='Perform and visualize a text analysis.',
      author='Your Name',
      packages=['text_analyzer'])
```

### Explanation:
- **`from setuptools import setup`**: Imports the `setup` function needed to create the package installation.
- **`name='text_analyzer'`**: Specifies the name of the package.
- **`version='0.0.1'`**: Sets the version of your package.
- **`description='Perform and visualize a text analysis.'`**: A brief description of what your package does.
- **`author='Your Name'`**: Replace `'Your Name'` with your actual name.
- **`packages=['text_analyzer']`**: Specifies the directory where your package is located, which is `text_analyzer` in this case.
