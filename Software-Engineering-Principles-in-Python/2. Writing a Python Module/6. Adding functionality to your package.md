# Adding functionality to your package

Adding functionality to your package
Thanks to your work before, you already have a skeleton for your python package. In this exercise, you will work to define the functions needed for a text analysis of word usage.

In the file counter_utils.py, you will write 2 functions to be a part of your package: plot_counter and sum_counters. The structure of your package can be seen in the tree below. For the coding portions of this exercise, you will be working in the file counter_utils.py.

Define top_items using plot_counter's inputs.


# Import needed functionality
from collections import Counter

def plot_counter(counter, n_most_common=5):
  # Subset the n_most_common items from the input counter
  top_items = ____.most_common(____)
  # Plot `top_items`
  plot_counter_most_common(top_items)

You can define `top_items` using the `most_common()` method from the `Counter` class. Here’s how you complete the code:

```python
# Import needed functionality
from collections import Counter

def plot_counter(counter, n_most_common=5):
  # Subset the n_most_common items from the input counter
  top_items = counter.most_common(n_most_common)
  # Plot `top_items`
  plot_counter_most_common(top_items)
```

Explanation:
- `counter.most_common(n_most_common)` returns the `n_most_common` most common elements and their counts from the `Counter` object.
- `top_items` will hold these most common items, which can then be used for plotting.

To aggregate multiple `Counter` objects, you can pass them to the `sum()` function. Here's how to implement the `sum_counters` function using `sum()`:

```python
# Import needed functionality
from collections import Counter

def sum_counters(counters):
    # Sum the list of Counter objects
    return sum(counters, Counter())
```

### Explanation:
- `sum(counters, Counter())` takes a list of `Counter` objects and sums them up.
- The second argument, `Counter()`, is the starting point (an empty `Counter` object) for the summation.
- This allows you to sum any number of `Counter` objects by passing them as a list to the `sum()` function.

Question
You just wrote two functions for your package in the file counter_utils.py named plot_counter & sum_counters. Which of the following lines would correctly import these functions in __init__.py using relative import syntax?

Possible answers


from counter_utils import plot_counter, sum_counters

from .counter_utils import plot_counter, sum_counters

from . import plot_counter, sum_counters

from .counter_utils import plot_counter & sum_counters

The correct line to import the `plot_counter` and `sum_counters` functions using relative import syntax in `__init__.py` is:

```python
from .counter_utils import plot_counter, sum_counters
```

### Explanation:
- **`from .counter_utils import plot_counter, sum_counters`** is the correct relative import syntax. The `.` refers to the current package (in this case, `text_analyzer`), and then you specify the module (`counter_utils`) and the functions you want to import.
  
The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:
- `from counter_utils import plot_counter, sum_counters` uses an absolute import, which is not a relative import.
- `from . import plot_counter, sum_counters` is incorrect because `plot_counter` and `sum_counters` are functions, not modules. You can't import them like modules with `import`.
- `from .counter_utils import plot_counter & sum_counters` is incorrect because the `&` operator is used for bitwise operations, not for importing multiple items.
