# Exploring with dir and help

Exploring with dir and help
A new method has been added to the Document class. The method is a convenience wrapper around the plot_counter() function you wrote in an earlier exercise. In this exercise, you'll use dir() and help() to identify how to utilize the new method.

import the text_analyzer package.
Define my_doc as an instance of Document with the text stored in datacamp_tweets. datacamp_tweets has been pre-loaded in your environment

# Import needed package
____

# Create instance of document
my_doc = ____(datacamp_tweets)

To follow the instructions:

1. **Import the `text_analyzer` package**.
2. **Create an instance of `Document`** using the pre-loaded `datacamp_tweets` as text.

Hereâ€™s the code:

```python
# Import needed package
import text_analyzer

# Create instance of document
my_doc = text_analyzer.Document(datacamp_tweets)
```

### Explanation:
- **`import text_analyzer`**: This imports your custom package containing the `Document` class.
- **`my_doc = text_analyzer.Document(datacamp_tweets)`**: This creates an instance of the `Document` class using the `datacamp_tweets` text.

Question
Use dir to show all of my_doc's methods and attributes. What is the name of the new plot method from the resulting list.

Possible answers


plot_word_counts

plot_counts

plot_words

plot_text

To see all the methods and attributes of `my_doc` and identify the new plot method, you would use the `dir()` function as follows:

```python
# Use dir() to list all methods and attributes of my_doc
print(dir(my_doc))
```

From the resulting list, you would look for the method that matches the description of the new plot method.

### Expected answer:
- The name of the new plot method is **`plot_word_counts`**.

This method would likely be a convenience wrapper around the `plot_counter()` function to visualize word counts directly from the `Document` class.

Run help() on the plot method you discovered with dir() to see how to properly use the functionality.
Plot my_doc's word counts using the new plot method.

# Import needed package
import text_analyzer

# Create instance of document
my_doc = text_analyzer.Document(datacamp_tweets)

# Run help on my_doc's plot method
help(my_doc.____)

# Plot the word_counts of my_doc
my_doc.____()


```py
# Import needed package
import text_analyzer

# Create instance of document
my_doc = text_analyzer.Document(datacamp_tweets)

# Run help on my_doc's plot method
help(my_doc.plot_counts)

# Plot the word_counts of my_doc
my_doc.plot_counts()


```

Sure! Here's a breakdown of the code:

### 1. Import the needed package
```python
import text_analyzer
```
This line imports the `text_analyzer` module, which contains the `Document` class and its methods, including the `plot_counts()` method. By importing this module, you make its classes and functions available for use in your script.

### 2. Create an instance of the Document class
```python
my_doc = text_analyzer.Document(datacamp_tweets)
```
Here, an instance of the `Document` class is created. The `Document` class is designed to process and analyze text, and when you create an instance of it (`my_doc`), you pass the `datacamp_tweets` string as the `text` argument to the class. The class will:
- Tokenize the text
- Count the words
These actions are performed automatically by the `__init__()` method of the `Document` class, which processes the text upon initialization.

### 3. Run help on `my_doc.plot_counts`
```python
help(my_doc.plot_counts)
```
This line uses Python's built-in `help()` function to display documentation about the `plot_counts()` method of the `my_doc` object. The `help()` function provides information about the method's purpose, how to use it, what parameters it expects, and any other relevant details.

- In this case, it's checking if the `plot_counts()` method requires arguments, what kind of arguments, and its functionality.

### 4. Plot the word counts of `my_doc`
```python
my_doc.plot_counts()
```
This line calls the `plot_counts()` method on `my_doc`. Based on the earlier exploration with `help()`, you learned that this method doesn't require any arguments, so you can directly call it with parentheses `()`.

- The `plot_counts()` method generates a plot visualizing the word counts from the text stored in `my_doc`. This would typically show how frequently each word appears in the text (as stored in the `word_counts` attribute, which was generated automatically by the `Document` class).

### Summary:
The code first creates a `Document` instance and processes the text (`datacamp_tweets`). Then, it checks the documentation of `plot_counts()` to understand how to use it (confirming no arguments are required). Finally, it calls `plot_counts()` to generate a plot based on the word counts in the document.

This process illustrates how to use object-oriented features in Python, such as class methods and the `help()` function, to explore and utilize the functionality provided by a class.
