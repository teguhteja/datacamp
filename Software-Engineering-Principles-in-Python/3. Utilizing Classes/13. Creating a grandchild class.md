# Creating a grandchild class

Creating a grandchild class
In this exercise you will be using inheritance to create a Tweet class from your SocialMedia class. This new grandchild class of Document will be able to tackle Twitter specific details such as retweets.

Complete the class statement so that Tweets inherits from SocialMedia. SocialMedia has already been loaded in your environment.
Use super() to call the __init__ method of the parent class.
Define retweet_text. Use help() to complete the call to filter_lines with the correct parameter name. filter_lines has already been loaded in your environment.
return retweet_text from _process_retweets as an instance of SocialMedia.

# Define a Tweet class that inherits from SocialMedia
class Tweets(____):
    def __init__(self, text):
        # Call parent's __init__ with super()
        ____
        # Define retweets attribute with non-public method
        self.retweets = self._process_retweets()

    def _process_retweets(self):
        # Filter tweet text to only include retweets
        retweet_text = filter_lines(self.text, ____='RT')
        # Return retweet_text as a SocialMedia object
        return ____(retweet_text)

```py
# Define a Tweet class that inherits from SocialMedia
class Tweets(SocialMedia):
    def __init__(self, text):
        # Call parent's __init__ with super()
        super().__init__()
        # Define retweets attribute with non-public method
        self.retweets = self._process_retweets()

    def _process_retweets(self):
        # Filter tweet text to only include retweets
        retweet_text = filter_lines(self.text, first_chars='RT')
        # Return retweet_text as a SocialMedia object
        return SocialMedia(retweet_text)



```

Let's break down the provided code and explain how each part works.

### Code Explanation

```python
# Define a Tweet class that inherits from SocialMedia
class Tweets(SocialMedia):
    def __init__(self, text):
        # Call parent's __init__ with super()
        super().__init__()
        # Define retweets attribute with non-public method
        self.retweets = self._process_retweets()

    def _process_retweets(self):
        # Filter tweet text to only include retweets
        retweet_text = filter_lines(self.text, first_chars='RT')
        # Return retweet_text as a SocialMedia object
        return SocialMedia(retweet_text)
```

### 1. **Class Definition:**
   ```python
   class Tweets(SocialMedia):
   ```
   - This defines a new class `Tweets` that **inherits** from `SocialMedia`.
   - The `SocialMedia` class itself inherits from the `Document` class. So, `Tweets` inherits all the functionality of `SocialMedia`, which includes text processing, tokenization, counting word occurrences, hashtags, and mentions.

### 2. **`__init__` Method:**
   ```python
   def __init__(self, text):
       # Call parent's __init__ with super()
       super().__init__()
   ```
   - The `__init__` method is the **constructor** for the `Tweets` class. It is called when a new instance of the `Tweets` class is created.
   - Inside the `__init__` method, `super().__init__()` is used to **call the `__init__` method** of the parent class (`SocialMedia`). This ensures that the functionality from `SocialMedia` (which was inherited from `Document`) is initialized properly. Specifically, it initializes the `text` attribute, tokenizes the text, and calculates word counts, hashtags, and mentions.
   - The reason why we use `super()` here is to follow the principles of **inheritance**, ensuring that we don't need to reimplement the logic from the parent class but can instead extend it.

### 3. **Defining the `retweets` Attribute:**
   ```python
   self.retweets = self._process_retweets()
   ```
   - This line creates an instance attribute `retweets` and assigns it the result of calling the `_process_retweets()` method.
   - The `_process_retweets()` method will be responsible for identifying and extracting retweets from the original tweet text.

### 4. **The `_process_retweets` Method:**
   ```python
   def _process_retweets(self):
       # Filter tweet text to only include retweets
       retweet_text = filter_lines(self.text, first_chars='RT')
       # Return retweet_text as a SocialMedia object
       return SocialMedia(retweet_text)
   ```
   - This method is used to **filter** the tweet text (`self.text`) and identify which parts of the text are retweets.
   - `filter_lines(self.text, first_chars='RT')` is used to **filter out the retweets** from the original tweet text. The `filter_lines` function will look at each line of text and check if it **starts with** 'RT' (the typical indicator for retweets in Twitter text). The parameter `first_chars='RT'` tells `filter_lines` to look for lines beginning with the string "RT".
   - After filtering out the retweets, the filtered `retweet_text` is returned as a **`SocialMedia`** object. This allows us to treat the retweets in the same way as we would handle social media posts using the functionalities of the `SocialMedia` class.

### 5. **Why Use `SocialMedia` for Retweets?**
   - By returning the filtered `retweet_text` as an instance of `SocialMedia`, the retweets can be handled in a consistent way as regular social media posts, meaning we can analyze hashtags, mentions, and perform other operations on the retweets just like we would on a regular tweet.

### Summary:
- **`Tweets` class**: A new class that extends `SocialMedia`, making use of inheritance to manage functionality related to social media content (tweets).
- **Inheritance**: We use `super().__init__()` to call the constructor of the parent class (`SocialMedia`) and initialize the common functionality.
- **Filtering Retweets**: `_process_retweets` filters out retweets from the original tweet text (lines that begin with "RT") and processes them as a `SocialMedia` object, giving them the same functionality as regular social media posts.
