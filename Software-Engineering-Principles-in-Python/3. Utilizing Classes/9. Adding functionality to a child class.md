Adding functionality to a child class
You've just written a SocialMedia class that inherits functionality from Document. As of now, the SocialMedia class doesn't have any functionality different from Document. In this exercise, you will build features into SocialMedia to specialize it for use with Social Media data.

For reference, the definition of Document can be seen below.

class Document:
    # Initialize a new Document instance
    def __init__(self, text):
        self.text = text
        # Pre tokenize the document with non-public tokenize method
        self.tokens = self._tokenize()
        # Pre tokenize the document with non-public count_words
        self.word_counts = self._count_words()

    def _tokenize(self):
        return tokenize(self.text)

    # Non-public method to tally document's word counts
    def _count_words(self):
        # Use collections.Counter to count the document's tokens
        return Counter(self.tokens)

The function filter_word_counts() has been loaded in your session. Use help() to see its proper usage.
Finish the _count_hashtags method using filter_word_counts() so that only words_counts starting with # remain.

# Define a SocialMedia class that is a child of the `Document class`
class SocialMedia(Document):
    def __init__(self, text):
        Document.__init__(self, text)
        self.hashtag_counts = self._count_hashtags()
        
    def _count_hashtags(self):
        # Filter attribute so only words starting with '#' remain
        return ____

To finish the `_count_hashtags` method in the `SocialMedia` class using the `filter_word_counts()` function, you'll need to pass the `self.word_counts` (which is a `Counter` object containing word counts) to the `filter_word_counts()` function. The purpose of the method is to filter out only the words that start with `#` (hashtags) and return a new Counter containing those words.

Here's how you can complete the method:

```python
# Define a SocialMedia class that is a child of the `Document class`
class SocialMedia(Document):
    def __init__(self, text):
        Document.__init__(self, text)
        self.hashtag_counts = self._count_hashtags()

    def _count_hashtags(self):
        # Filter the word counts so only words starting with '#' remain
        return filter_word_counts(self.word_counts, '#')
```

### Explanation:
- **`filter_word_counts(self.word_counts, '#')`**: The `filter_word_counts()` function is used to filter out only those words from `self.word_counts` (the word count `Counter` object) that start with `#`. The second argument `'#'` specifies that only words beginning with a `#` should be retained.

This should now filter and count only the hashtags in the `word_counts` of the `SocialMedia` class. You can use `self.hashtag_counts` to access the filtered counts of hashtags.

Fill in the first line ofSocialMedia's __init__ method using the parent class to properly utilize inheritance.
Properly call the _count_mentions method in __init__ to add a new feature to SocialMedia.

# Define a SocialMedia class that is a child of the `Document class`
class SocialMedia(Document):
    def __init__(self, text):
        ____
        self.hashtag_counts = self._count_hashtags()
        self.mention_counts = ____
        
    def _count_hashtags(self):
        # Filter attribute so only words starting with '#' remain
        return filter_word_counts(self.word_counts, first_char='#')      
    
    def _count_mentions(self):
        # Filter attribute so only words starting with '@' remain
        return filter_word_counts(self.word_counts, first_char='@')

To correctly call the parent class’s `__init__` method in Python, you should use `super()` in the `SocialMedia` class. If the prompt indicates that the call should be `Document.__init__(self, text)`, you must specifically use this form instead of `super().__init__(text)`.

Here’s the corrected code that directly calls `Document.__init__(self, text)` as per the instructions:

```python
# Define a SocialMedia class that is a child of the `Document` class
class SocialMedia(Document):
    def __init__(self, text):
        Document.__init__(self, text)  # Correctly calling the parent class __init__ method
        self.hashtag_counts = self._count_hashtags()  # Count hashtags
        self.mention_counts = self._count_mentions()  # Count mentions
        
    def _count_hashtags(self):
        # Filter attribute so only words starting with '#' remain
        return filter_word_counts(self.word_counts, first_char='#')
    
    def _count_mentions(self):
        # Filter attribute so only words starting with '@' remain
        return filter_word_counts(self.word_counts, first_char='@')
```

### Key Point:
- **`Document.__init__(self, text)`**: This directly calls the `__init__` method of the `Document` class, initializing the `SocialMedia` object as a subclass of `Document`.
  
Now, this version correctly uses `Document.__init__(self, text)` as required.
