# Writing a class for your package

Writing a class for your package
We've covered how classes can be written in Python. In this exercise, you'll be creating the beginnings of a Document class that will be a foundation for text analysis in your package. Once the class is written you will modify your package's __init__.py file to make it easily accessible by your users.

Below is the structure of where you'll be working.

├── text_analyzer
│    ├── __init__.py
│    ├── counter_utils.py
│    ├── document.py
└── my_script.py

You are working in document.py.
Finish the def statement that will create a new Document instance when a user calls Document().
Use your knowledge of PEP 8 conventions to complete the definition of the newly named class method.

# Define Document class
class Document:
    """A class for text analysis
    
    :param text: string of text to be analyzed
    :ivar text: string of text to be analyzed; set by `text` parameter
    """
    # Method to create a new instance of Document
    def ____(____, text):
        # Store text parameter to the text attribute
        ____.text = text

Here’s how you can complete the `Document` class in `document.py` following the PEP 8 conventions:

```python
# Define Document class
class Document:
    """A class for text analysis
    
    :param text: string of text to be analyzed
    :ivar text: string of text to be analyzed; set by `text` parameter
    """
    # Method to create a new instance of Document
    def __init__(self, text):
        # Store text parameter to the text attribute
        self.text = text
```

### Explanation:
- **`def __init__(self, text):`**: The `__init__` method is the constructor of the class that gets called when a new instance of the class is created. The `self` parameter refers to the instance itself, and `text` is the parameter passed when creating the `Document` instance.
- **`self.text = text`**: This line stores the passed `text` argument into an instance attribute called `text`.

This is the correct implementation following PEP 8 and ensuring that the class behaves as expected.


Question
You just completed writing the Document class for your package in document.py. Which of the following lines would correctly import this class in __init__.py using relative import syntax?

Possible answers


from document import Document

from . import Document

from .document import Document

from .document import document


The correct line to import the `Document` class in `__init__.py` using relative import syntax is:

**`from .document import Document`**

### Explanation:
- **`from .document import Document`**: This correctly uses relative import syntax to import the `Document` class from the `document.py` file located in the same `text_analyzer` directory as `__init__.py`.
  
The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:
- **`from document import Document`**: This is an absolute import, which is not using relative import syntax.
- **`from . import Document`**: This tries to import `Document` as a module, but it should be imported from `document`, not as a standalone module.
- **`from .document import document`**: This would attempt to import a variable or instance named `document` from the `document.py` file, which doesn't exist in the class definition.
