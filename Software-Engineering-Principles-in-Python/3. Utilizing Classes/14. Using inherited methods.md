# Using inherited methods

Using inherited methods
You've now defined a Tweets class that's inherited methods from both Document and SocialMedia. In this exercise, you'll use inherited methods to visualize text from both tweets and retweets.

Be aware that this is real data from Twitter and as such there is always a risk that it may contain profanity or other offensive content (in this exercise, and any following exercises that also use real Twitter data).

import your text_analyzer package.
Define my_tweets as an instance of Tweets using the datacamp_tweets data that has been pre-loaded into your environment.

# Import needed package
import ____

# Create instance of Tweets
my_tweets = ____

Here is how you can complete the code based on the instructions:

```python
# Import needed package
import text_analyzer

# Create instance of Tweets
my_tweets = text_analyzer.Tweets(datacamp_tweets)
```

### Explanation:
1. **`import text_analyzer`**: This imports the `text_analyzer` package, which contains the `Tweets` class and other related functions.
2. **`my_tweets = text_analyzer.Tweets(datacamp_tweets)`**: This creates an instance of the `Tweets` class using the pre-loaded `datacamp_tweets` data. `datacamp_tweets` contains tweet text, and the `Tweets` class will process this text, handle retweets, hashtags, and mentions as described in your class implementation.

Make sure the `text_analyzer` package is already available in your environment for this to work!

2
Use the plot_counts() method to plot the top 'hashtag_counts'.
Make sure to check the documentation for my_tweets.plot_counts.

# Import needed package
import text_analyzer

# Create instance of Tweets
my_tweets = text_analyzer.Tweets(datacamp_tweets)

# Plot the most used hashtags in the tweets
my_tweets.plot_counts('____')

To plot the most used hashtags in the tweets using the `plot_counts()` method, you need to pass the correct attribute related to the hashtags. Based on the previous class definitions, the `hashtag_counts` attribute stores the filtered word counts for hashtags.

Here's the completed code:

```python
# Import needed package
import text_analyzer

# Create instance of Tweets
my_tweets = text_analyzer.Tweets(datacamp_tweets)

# Plot the most used hashtags in the tweets
my_tweets.plot_counts('hashtag_counts')
```

### Explanation:
- **`my_tweets.plot_counts('hashtag_counts')`**: This calls the `plot_counts()` method and passes the `'hashtag_counts'` attribute. The `hashtag_counts` contains the counts of all hashtags in the tweets, and the method will plot this data. Make sure to check the `help()` documentation for `plot_counts()` to confirm that it can accept this argument.


3
Use the plot_counts() method of the retweets attribute to plot the most used hashtag_counts in the retweets subset of the data.
# Import needed package
import text_analyzer

# Create instance of Tweets
my_tweets = text_analyzer.Tweets(datacamp_tweets)

# Plot the most used hashtags in the retweets
my_tweets.____


To plot the most used hashtags in the retweets subset of the data, you need to use the `retweets` attribute of `my_tweets`, which is an instance of `SocialMedia`. Then, call the `plot_counts()` method on it and pass the `'hashtag_counts'` to focus on the hashtags.

Here's the completed code:

```python
# Import needed package
import text_analyzer

# Create instance of Tweets
my_tweets = text_analyzer.Tweets(datacamp_tweets)

# Plot the most used hashtags in the retweets
my_tweets.retweets.plot_counts('hashtag_counts')
```

### Explanation:
- **`my_tweets.retweets`**: This accesses the `retweets` attribute, which is a `SocialMedia` object containing retweet data.
- **`plot_counts('hashtag_counts')`**: The `plot_counts()` method is called on the `retweets` attribute, and `'hashtag_counts'` is passed to focus on plotting the hashtags in the retweets subset.
