# Using pytest

Using pytest
doctest is a great tool, but it's not nearly as powerful as pytest. In this exercise, you'll write tests for your SocialMedia class using the pytest framework.

Question
Before you start writing tests, you need to be working in an appropriately named file for pytest to find your test. Which of the following would be the best, valid name for file containing tests for the SocialMedia class?

Possible answers


test_social_media.py

pytest_social_media.py

social_media_tests.py

test_sm.py


The correct answer is `test_social_media.py`

Let's explain why this is the best choice and why the others aren't as good:

1. `test_social_media.py` ✅ (BEST)
   - Follows pytest's naming convention of `test_*.py`
   - Clearly indicates what's being tested (social_media)
   - Is descriptive and specific
   - Will be automatically discovered by pytest

2. `pytest_social_media.py` ❌
   - Doesn't follow pytest's standard naming convention
   - Won't be automatically discovered by pytest
   - Using 'pytest' in the filename could be confused with pytest's own files

3. `social_media_tests.py` ❌
   - Doesn't follow pytest's naming convention of starting with `test_`
   - Won't be automatically discovered by pytest
   - While descriptive, it doesn't follow the standard pattern

4. `test_sm.py` ❌
   - While it follows the `test_` convention
   - The abbreviation 'sm' is too vague
   - Lacks clarity about what's being tested
   - Could be confused with other modules that have the same initials

Key points about pytest file naming:
1. Files must start with `test_` or end with `_test.py`
2. pytest automatically discovers these files
3. Names should be descriptive and clear
4. Follow Python naming conventions (lowercase with underscores)

Best practices:
- Use `test_` prefix (more common than `_test` suffix)
- Include the name of the module being tested
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Avoid abbreviations
- Keep names consistent with the module being tested

import the SocialMedia class.
Complete the name of the test function so it is run by pytest.
Use the appropriate keyword to test that the hashtag_counts are as expected.

```py
from collections import Counter
from text_analyzer import ____

# Create an instance of SocialMedia for testing
test_post = 'learning #python & #rstats is awesome! thanks @datacamp!'
sm_post = SocialMedia(test_post)

# Test hashtag counts are created properly
def ____social_media_hashtags():
    expected_hashtag_counts = Counter({'#python': 1, '#rstats': 1})
    ____ sm_post.hashtag_counts == expected_hashtag_counts
```

Let's complete the test file with proper pytest conventions:

```python
Execute
Copy Code
from collections import Counter
from text_analyzer import SocialMedia

# Create an instance of SocialMedia for testing
test_post = 'learning #python & #rstats is awesome! thanks @datacamp!'
sm_post = SocialMedia(test_post)

# Test hashtag counts are created properly
def test_social_media_hashtags():
  expected_hashtag_counts = Counter({'#python': 1, '#rstats': 1})
  assert sm_post.hashtag_counts == expected_hashtag_counts
```
Let's break down the key components:

Import statement:
python
Copy Code
   from text_analyzer import SocialMedia
Imports the SocialMedia class we want to test
Test function naming:

python
Copy Code
   assert sm_post.hashtag_counts == expected_hashtag_counts
Uses assert keyword for testing
Compares actual hashtag counts with expected counts
Will fail if they don't match exactly
Key points about this pytest test:

Function name starts with test_ for pytest discovery
Uses assert for verification
Tests specific functionality (hashtag counting)
Has clear expected outcomes
Uses Counter for comparison
When run, pytest will:

Find this file because it starts with test_
Find this function because it starts with test_
Run the assertion
Pass if the hashtag counts match
Fail with helpful output if they don't match
