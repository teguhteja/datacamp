# Using good function names

Using good function names
A good function name can go a long way for both user and maintainer understanding. A good function name is descriptive and describes what a function does. In this exercise, you'll choose a name for a function that will help aid in its readability when used.

The math module has been pre-loaded into your environment to be able to use its sqrt function.
Give function the best possible name from the following options: do_stuff, hypotenuse_length, square_root_of_leg_a_squared_plus_leg_b_squared, pythagorean_theorem.
Complete the docstring's example with the function's name.
print the result of using the newly named function to find the length of the hypotenuse for a right triangle with legs of length 6 & 8.

def ____(leg_a, leg_b):
    """Find the length of a right triangle's hypotenuse

    :param leg_a: length of one leg of triangle
    :param leg_b: length of other leg of triangle
    :return: length of hypotenuse
    
    >>> ____(3, 4)
    5
    """
    return math.sqrt(leg_a**2 + leg_b**2)


# Print the length of the hypotenuse with legs 6 & 8
print(____)


Let's analyze the function name options:

do_stuff - Too vague, doesn't describe what the function does
hypotenuse_length - Clear, concise, and describes the output
square_root_of_leg_a_squared_plus_leg_b_squared - Too long and detailed
pythagorean_theorem - Describes the formula used but not what it returns
The best choice would be hypotenuse_length as it clearly describes what the function returns without being too verbose or too vague.

Here's the completed code:

python
Copy Code
import math

def hypotenuse_length(leg_a, leg_b):
  """Find the length of a right triangle's hypotenuse

  :param leg_a: length of one leg of triangle
  :param leg_b: length of other leg of triangle
  :return: length of hypotenuse
  
  >>> hypotenuse_length(3, 4)
  5
  """
  return math.sqrt(leg_a**2 + leg_b**2)


# Print the length of the hypotenuse with legs 6 & 8
print(hypotenuse_length(6, 8))
When you run this code, it will output 10.0, which is the length of the hypotenuse for a right triangle with legs of length 6 and 8.

The function name hypotenuse_length:

Is descriptive of what the function returns
Is clear and concise
Makes the code readable when used
Follows Python naming conventions (lowercase with underscores)
Makes it obvious what the function does without having to read the docstring
Execution Result:
