# Documenting classes for Sphinx

Documenting classes for Sphinx
sphinx is a great tool for rendering documentation as HTML. In this exercise, you'll write a docstring for a class that can be taken advantage of by sphinx.

Note that your docstring submission must match the solution exactly. If you find yourself getting it wrong several times, it may be a good idea to refresh the sample code and start over.

Instructions
100 XP
import the Document class from the text_analyzer package for use in the class definition.
Complete the line of the docstring dealing with the parameters of the __init__ method.
Complete the docstring by filling out the documentation for the attributes or 'instance variables' of the SocialMedia class.

____

class SocialMedia(Document):
    """Analyze text data from social media
    
    ____ social media text to analyze

    :____: Counter object containing counts of hashtags used in text
    :____: Counter object containing counts of @mentions used in text
    """
    def __init__(self, text):
        Document.__init__(self, text)
        self.hashtag_counts = self._count_hashtags()
        self.mention_counts = self._count_mentions()

Let's complete the class documentation following Sphinx conventions:

python
Execute
Copy Code
from text_analyzer import Document

class SocialMedia(Document):
  """Analyze text data from social media
  
  :param text: social media text to analyze

  :ivar hashtag_counts: Counter object containing counts of hashtags used in text
  :ivar mention_counts: Counter object containing counts of @mentions used in text
  """
  def __init__(self, text):
      Document.__init__(self, text)
      self.hashtag_counts = self._count_hashtags()
      self.mention_counts = self._count_mentions()
Let's break down the components:

Import statement:
python
Copy Code
   from text_analyzer import Document


python
Copy Code
   :ivar hashtag_counts: Counter object containing counts of hashtags used in text
   :ivar mention_counts: Counter object containing counts of @mentions used in text
Uses :ivar: to document instance variables
Describes what each attribute contains
Specifies the type (Counter object) and purpose
Key points about Sphinx documentation:

Uses reStructuredText format
:param: for method parameters
:ivar: for instance variables
Clear, concise descriptions
Consistent formatting
The docstring will allow Sphinx to:

Generate HTML documentation
Show class inheritance from Document
List and describe parameters
Document instance variables
Format everything consistently
This documentation style helps users understand:

What the class does
What input it expects
What attributes are available
The types and purposes of attributes
