Let's analyze each concept and its corresponding tools, then evaluate each option:

Concepts we're matching:
1. Modularity
2. Documentation
3. Automated Testing

Looking at the options:

1. "Docstrings, Travis CI, & Python"
- Docstrings → Documentation
- Travis CI → Automated Testing
- Python → Not specifically a tool for any of these concepts
❌ Not the best match

2. "Pytest, Codecov, & Sphinx"
- Pytest → Automated Testing
- Codecov → Automated Testing
- Sphinx → Documentation
❌ Missing modularity tool

3. "GitHub, GitLab, & Git"
- All are version control/collaboration tools
❌ Don't specifically address the three concepts

4. "Code Climate, Sphinx, & Travis CI"
- Code Climate → Modularity (helps maintain code quality and structure)
- Sphinx → Documentation
- Travis CI → Automated Testing
✅ CORRECT ANSWER

The best answer is "Code Climate, Sphinx, & Travis CI" because:
1. Code Climate helps with Modularity by:
   - Analyzing code structure
   - Identifying complexity issues
   - Suggesting improvements for better modularity

2. Sphinx helps with Documentation by:
   - Generating comprehensive documentation
   - Supporting various documentation formats
   - Creating readable HTML documentation

3. Travis CI helps with Automated Testing by:
   - Automatically running tests
   - Continuous integration
   - Ensuring code quality through automated testing

This option provides one appropriate tool for each concept in the correct order: Modularity, Documentation, & Automated Testing.
