# Identifying good comments

Identifying good comments
We learned about what characteristics make a 'good' comment. In this exercise, you'll apply this knowledge to identify a function that utilizes comment best practices.

    return re.findall(r'\$\d+\.\d\d', text)

def extract_1(text):
    # return all matches to regex pattern

```python
import re

def extract_0(text):
    # match and extract dollar amounts from the text
    return re.findall(r'\$\d+\.\d\d', text)

def extract_1(text):
    # return all matches to regex pattern
    return re.findall(r'\$\d+\.\d\d', text)

# Print the text
print(text)

# Print the results of the function with better commenting
print(extract_0(text))
```

Sure! Let's break down and explain the code step by step.

### Code Explanation

1. **`import re`**
   - The `re` module in Python is imported, which stands for "regular expression." This module provides functions to perform pattern matching and text extraction using regular expressions. In this code, `re` is used to search for and extract patterns from a string.

2. **Function `extract_0`**
   ```python
   def extract_0(text):
       # match and extract dollar amounts from the text
       return re.findall(r'\$\d+\.\d\d', text)
   ```
   - **Purpose**: This function takes a string, `text`, and uses the `re.findall()` function to match and extract all dollar amounts.
   - **Comment**: "match and extract dollar amounts from the text" explains that the function is intended to find patterns that represent dollar amounts.
   - **Explanation of the Regular Expression `r'\$\d+\.\d\d'`**:
     - `r`: Denotes a raw string, which means special characters are not escaped.
     - `\$`: Matches the dollar sign `$`. The backslash `\` is needed to escape the `$` because it is a special character in regex.
     - `\d+`: Matches one or more digits.
     - `\.`: Matches the decimal point.
     - `\d\d`: Matches exactly two digits after the decimal point.
   - **Usage**: The function returns a list of strings, where each string is a dollar amount in the format `$XX.XX`.

3. **Function `extract_1`**
   ```python
   def extract_1(text):
       # return all matches to regex pattern
       return re.findall(r'\$\d+\.\d\d', text)
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Similar to `extract_0`, this function uses the same regular expression to extract dollar amounts from the `text`.
   - **Comment**: "return all matches to regex pattern" is less descriptive, only indicating that it returns matches without giving additional context or explaining why it's used.
   - **Functionality**: It performs the same task as `extract_0` but lacks a comment that explains the context or purpose.

4. **Printing the Text**
   ```python
   # Print the text
   print(text)
   ```
   - **Purpose**: This line prints the value of the `text` variable. However, to run this code correctly, `text` should be defined somewhere before this line. For example:
     ```python
     text = "The total cost is $10.99, and the deposit was $5.50."
     ```
   - **Explanation**: Without defining `text`, the code will throw an error. Assuming `text` contains some text with dollar amounts, it will display the contents of `text`.

5. **Printing the Results of `extract_0`**
   ```python
   # Print the results of the function with better commenting
   print(extract_0(text))
   ```
   - **Purpose**: This line calls the `extract_0` function with `text` as an argument and prints the list of extracted dollar amounts.
   - **Explanation**: Since `extract_0` has more descriptive comments, the code emphasizes that this function provides clearer context for what it does.

### Summary
- **Key Concepts**: 
  - The code uses regular expressions to identify and extract dollar amounts from a string.
  - `extract_0` has better commenting that explains the purpose of the code, while `extract_1` has a more generic comment.
- **Output**: If `text` is defined properly, the program will print `text` and then a list of dollar amounts found in the `text`.

### Example
If `text` is:
```python
text = "The total cost is $10.99, and the deposit was $5.50."
```
The output will be:
```
The total cost is $10.99, and the deposit was $5.50.
['$10.99', '$5.50']
``` 

This shows how dollar amounts were successfully extracted from the text.
