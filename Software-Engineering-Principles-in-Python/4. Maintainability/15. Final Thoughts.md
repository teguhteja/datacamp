# Final Thoughts

1. Final Thoughts
00:00 - 00:13
Congratulations on completing the course! You've come a long way. Throughout the course, we explored the ideas related to the major concepts of modularity, documentation, and automated testing.

2. Looking Back
00:13 - 00:22
With modularity we learned about things such as functions, classes, packages, and the DRY principle.

3. Looking Back
00:22 - 00:28
We learned how docstrings, comments, and sphinx can help document a project.

4. Looking Back
00:28 - 00:36
And we learned how pytest, doctest, and Travis CI can be used to help implement automated testing.

5. Data Science & Software Engineering
00:36 - 00:52
Hopefully, you'll agree with me that applying these concepts in your data science workflow will lead to much more maintainable code. Following these ideas will even help you in publishing your own open source tools for data science that your users will love!

6. Good Luck!
00:52 - 01:04
Thanks for coming along with me as we learned about Software Engineering for Data Science in Python. I hope you learned a lot! Good luck in your future software engineering projects!
