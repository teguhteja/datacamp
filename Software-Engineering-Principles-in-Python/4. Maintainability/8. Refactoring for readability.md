# Refactoring for readability

Refactoring for readability
Refactoring longer functions into smaller units can help with both readability and modularity. In this exercise, you will refactor a function into smaller units. The function you will be refactoring is shown below. Note, in the exercise, you won't be using docstrings for the sake of space; in a real application, you should include documentation!

def polygon_area(n_sides, side_len):
    """Find the area of a regular polygon

    :param n_sides: number of sides
    :param side_len: length of polygon sides
    :return: area of polygon

    >>> round(polygon_area(4, 5))
    25
    """
    perimeter = n_sides * side_len

    apothem_denominator = 2 * math.tan(math.pi / n_sides)
    apothem = side_len / apothem_denominator

    return perimeter * apothem / 2
Instructions

Move the logic for calculating the perimeter into the polygon_perimeter function.
Complete the definition of the polygon_apothem function, by moving the logic seen in the context. The math module has already been imported for you.
Utilize the new unit functions to complete the definition of polygon_area.
Use the more unitized polygon_area to calculate the area of a regular hexagon with legs of size 10.

def polygon_perimeter(n_sides, side_len):
    return ____

def polygon_apothem(n_sides, side_len):
    denominator = ____
    return side_len / denominator

def polygon_area(n_sides, side_len):
    perimeter = ____
    apothem = ____

    return perimeter * apothem / 2

# Print the area of a hexagon with legs of size 10
print(____(n_sides=6, side_len=10))

Let's refactor the code by breaking it down into smaller, more focused functions. This will make the code more readable and easier to maintain.

python
Copy Code
import math

def polygon_perimeter(n_sides, side_len):
  return n_sides * side_len

def polygon_apothem(n_sides, side_len):
  denominator = 2 * math.tan(math.pi / n_sides)
  return side_len / denominator

def polygon_area(n_sides, side_len):
  perimeter = polygon_perimeter(n_sides, side_len)
  apothem = polygon_apothem(n_sides, side_len)

  return perimeter * apothem / 2

# Print the area of a hexagon with legs of size 10
print(polygon_area(n_sides=6, side_len=10))
Let's break down the refactoring:

polygon_perimeter:
Takes the perimeter calculation logic from the original function
Simply multiplies number of sides by side length
Clear, single responsibility
polygon_apothem:
Takes the apothem calculation logic from the original function
Calculates the denominator using the trigonometric formula
Returns the apothem value
Clear, single responsibility
polygon_area:
Now uses the helper functions to get perimeter and apothem
Combines these values to calculate the area
Much more readable and modular
Each step is clear
For a regular hexagon with side length 10, when you run this code, it will output approximately 259.81 square units.

Benefits of this refactoring:

Each function has a single, clear responsibility
The code is more modular and easier to test
The main function (polygon_area) is more readable
Each calculation can be reused independently if needed
Easier to modify or fix individual calculations
Easier to understand the overall logic
Execution Result:

259.8076211353316
