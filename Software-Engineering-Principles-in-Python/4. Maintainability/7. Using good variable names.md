# Using good variable names

Using good variable names
Just like functions, descriptive variable names can make your code much more readable. In this exercise, you'll write some code using good variable naming practices.

There's not always a clear best name for a variable. The exercise has been written to try and make a clear best choice from the provided options.

Choose the best variable name to hold the sample of pupil diameter measurements in millimeters from the following choices: d, diameter, pupil_diameter, or pupil_diameter_in_millimeters.
Take the mean of the measurements and assign it to a variable. Choose the best variable name to hold this mean from the following options: m, mean, mean_diameter, or mean_pupil_diameter_in_millimeters.
Print the resulting average pupil diameter.

from statistics import mean

# Sample measurements of pupil diameter in mm
____ = [3.3, 6.8, 7.0, 5.4, 2.7]

# Average pupil diameter from sample
____ = mean(____)

print(____)


Let's analyze the variable name options:

For the sample measurements:

d - Too vague
diameter - Not specific enough
pupil_diameter - Clear and specific
pupil_diameter_in_millimeters - Too verbose for a simple list
For the mean value:

m - Too vague
mean - Not specific enough
mean_diameter - Not specific enough
mean_pupil_diameter_in_millimeters - Too verbose
Here's the code with the best variable names:

python
Copy Code
from statistics import mean

# Sample measurements of pupil diameter in mm
pupil_diameter = [3.3, 6.8, 7.0, 5.4, 2.7]

# Average pupil diameter from sample
mean_diameter = mean(pupil_diameter)

print(mean_diameter)
When you run this code, it will output approximately 5.04.

Explanation of variable name choices:

For the measurements list:

pupil_diameter is the best choice because:
It's specific about what's being measured
The unit (mm) is already documented in the comment
It's clear without being overly verbose
It follows Python naming conventions
For the mean value:

mean_diameter is the best choice because:
It clearly indicates it's a mean value of diameter measurements
It's concise while remaining descriptive
It follows Python naming conventions
The context (pupil) is already established
Execution Result:

5.04
