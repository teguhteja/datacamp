# Identifying proper docstrings

Identifying proper docstrings
We covered how to write fully-fledged docstrings. Before writing one of your own, this exercise will help you practice by having you identify a properly formatted docstring.

In this exercise, you'll be using the functions goldilocks(), rapunzel(), mary(), and sleeping_beauty() which have been loaded in your environment.

Run help() on each of the 4 functions to view their docstrings.

# Run the help on all 4 functions
help(goldilocks)
____(rapunzel)
help(____)
____(____)

Here's how you can run `help()` on all four functions to view their docstrings:

```python
# Run the help on all 4 functions
help(goldilocks)
help(rapunzel)
help(mary)
help(sleeping_beauty)
```

Make sure to use `help()` on each function to display their respective docstrings.

Define result using the function that has the most complete docstring; only 1 of the 4 contains all the sections we covered. Call the function without any parameters.
print the result of the most well documented function.

# Run the help on all 4 functions
help(goldilocks)
help(rapunzel)
help(mary)
help(sleeping_beauty)

# Execute the function with most complete docstring
result = ____

# Print the result
____

Let's break down and explain this code snippet:

### Code Explanation

1. **Running `help()` on Each Function**
   ```python
   help(goldilocks)
   help(rapunzel)
   help(mary)
   help(sleeping_beauty)
   ```
   - **Purpose**: The `help()` function is used to display the docstring of each function. This helps you understand what each function does, the parameters it expects, the return values, and potentially see an example of usage.
   - **What to Look For**: You are looking for the function that has the most complete docstring, which should contain:
     - **Description**: An overview of what the function does.
     - **Parameter Documentation**: Information about the parameters the function takes (if any).
     - **Return Value Documentation**: What the function returns.
     - **Example**: A usage example to show how the function is used in practice.
   - **Output**: This will print the docstrings of the four functions to the console.

2. **Executing the Function with the Most Complete Docstring**
   ```python
   result = rapunzel()
   ```
   - **Explanation**: After reviewing the output of `help()`, it was determined that `rapunzel()` is the function with the most complete docstring.
   - **Calling the Function**: The function `rapunzel()` is called without any parameters, and the result of the function call is stored in the variable `result`.

3. **Printing the Result**
   ```python
   print(result)
   ```
   - **Purpose**: This line prints the output of the `rapunzel()` function to the console.
   - **Explanation**: By printing `result`, you can see what the `rapunzel()` function returns when executed.

### Summary
- **Goal**: To find and use the function with the most well-documented docstring. This ensures that you are following best practices by understanding the function's behavior and how to use it.
- **Why `rapunzel()`?**: The code snippet assumes that `rapunzel()` has the most complete docstring, containing all necessary documentation sections. If another function has a more complete docstring based on the `help()` output, you should replace `rapunzel()` with that function.

### Example of a Complete Docstring
A complete docstring might look something like this:
```python
"""
Rapunzel Function

Description:
This function simulates Rapunzel letting down her hair. It returns a string indicating how far the hair reached.

Parameters:
None

Returns:
str: A message indicating the length of the hair.

Example:
>>> rapunzel()
'Rapunzel let down her hair, and it reached the ground!'
"""
```

Make sure to adjust which function you use based on the information given in the docstrings!
