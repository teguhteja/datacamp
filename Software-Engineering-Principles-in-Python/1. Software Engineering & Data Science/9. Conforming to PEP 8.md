# Conforming to PEP 8

Conforming to PEP 8
As we've covered, there are tools available to check if your code conforms to the PEP 8 guidelines. One possible way to stay compliant is to use an IDE that warns you when you accidentally stray from the style guide. Another way to check code is to use the pycodestyle package.

The results below show the output of running pycodestyle check against the code shown in your editor. The leading number in each line shows how many occurrences there were of that particular violation.

my_script.py:2:2:  E225 missing whitespace around operator
my_script.py:2:7:  E231 missing whitespace after ','
my_script.py:2:9:  E231 missing whitespace after ','
my_script.py:5:7:  E201 whitespace after '('
my_script.py:5:11: E202 whitespace before ')'

Leverage the output of pycodestyle to edit the code to be compliant with PEP 8.

# Assign data to x
x=[8,3,4]

# Print the data
print(   x )

To conform to PEP 8 based on the violations provided by `pycodestyle`, you'll need to make the following corrections:

1. **E225 missing whitespace around operator**: Add spaces around the assignment operator (`=`).
2. **E231 missing whitespace after `,`**: Ensure there is a space after the commas in lists.
3. **E201 whitespace after `(`**: Add a space after the opening parenthesis.
4. **E202 whitespace before `)`**: Add a space before the closing parenthesis.

Hereâ€™s the corrected code:

```python
# Assign data to x
x = [8, 3, 4]

# Print the data
print(x)
```

### Explanation of changes:
- **Spaces around the assignment operator**: `x = [8, 3, 4]` (adds space around `=`)
- **Spaces after commas**: `[8, 3, 4]` (adds spaces after the commas)
- **Whitespace after `(` and before `)`**: `print(x)` (removes extra spaces inside the parentheses)

This corrected version of the code should now comply with PEP 8.
