# Leveraging documentation

Leveraging documentation
When writing code for Data Science, it's inevitable that you'll need to install and use someone else's code. You'll quickly learn that using someone else's code is much more pleasant when they use good software engineering practices. In particular, good documentation makes the right way to call a function obvious. In this exercise you'll use python's help() method to view a function's documentation so you can determine how to correctly call a new method.

View the documentation of the Counter.most_common method using the help() function. Note, you need to run the import statement before completing this step.

# load the Counter function into our environment
from collections import Counter

# View the documentation for Counter.most_common
____(Counter.most_common)

To view the documentation for the `most_common` method from the `Counter` class, you can use the `help()` function. Here's how to complete the code:

```python
# load the Counter function into our environment
from collections import Counter

# View the documentation for Counter.most_common
help(Counter.most_common)
```

### Explanation:
- `from collections import Counter`: This imports the `Counter` class from Python's `collections` module.
- `help(Counter.most_common)`: This will display the documentation for the `most_common` method, which will explain how to use it, its parameters, and its return value.

Running this code will open the documentation for `most_common` in the Python interpreter or console.

Correctly call Counter.most_common() by reading its documentation.
Print the results stored in top_5_words.

# load the Counter function into our environment
from collections import Counter

# View the documentation for Counter.most_common
help(Counter.most_common)

# use Counter to find the top 5 most common words
top_5_words = Counter(____).most_common(____)

# display the top 5 most common words
print(____)

To correctly call the `most_common()` method and print the top 5 most common words, you should pass the list of words (or data) to the `Counter` and specify `5` as the argument to `most_common()` to get the top 5 most common items.

Here's the complete code:

```python
# load the Counter function into our environment
from collections import Counter

# View the documentation for Counter.most_common
help(Counter.most_common)

# use Counter to find the top 5 most common words
top_5_words = Counter(words).most_common(5)

# display the top 5 most common words
print(top_5_words)
```

### Explanation:
1. **`Counter(words)`**: This creates a `Counter` object from the `words` list (which should already be defined in your session).
2. **`most_common(5)`**: This method returns the 5 most common words along with their counts.
3. **`print(top_5_words)`**: This prints the result, which will be a list of tuples, each containing a word and its frequency.

This will display the top 5 most common words from the `words` list in the format:
```
[('word1', count1), ('word2', count2), ..., ('word5', count5)]
```
