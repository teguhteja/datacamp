Selective import
General imports, like import math, make all functionality from the math package available to you. However, if you decide to only use a specific part of a package, you can always make your import more selective:

from math import pi
Try the same thing again, but this time only use pi.

Perform a selective import from the math package where you only import the pi function.
Use math.pi to calculate the circumference of the circle and store it in C.
Use math.pi to calculate the area of the circle and store it in A.

# Import pi function of math package
from math import ____

# Calculate C
C = 2 * 0.43 * ____

# Calculate A
A = ____ * 0.43 ** 2

print("Circumference: " + str(C))
print("Area: " + str(A))
