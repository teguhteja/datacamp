# Different ways of importing

Different ways of importing
There are several ways to import packages and modules into Python. Depending on the import call, you'll have to use different Python code.

Suppose you want to use the function inv(), which is in the linalg subpackage of the scipy package. You want to be able to use this function as follows:

my_inv([[1,2], [3,4]])
Which import statement will you need in order to run the above code without an error?

import scipy

import scipy.linalg

from scipy.linalg import my_inv

from scipy.linalg import inv as my_inv

The correct import statement to use the function `inv()` as `my_inv()` is:

**`from scipy.linalg import inv as my_inv`**

### Explanation:

- **`import scipy`**: This would import the entire `scipy` package, but you would need to reference the full path (`scipy.linalg.inv()`), so this would not allow you to call the function as `my_inv()`.
  
- **`import scipy.linalg`**: This imports only the `linalg` subpackage of `scipy`, but you would still need to call `scipy.linalg.inv()`, not `my_inv()`.

- **`from scipy.linalg import my_inv`**: This would raise an error because there is no function called `my_inv` in `scipy.linalg`. The function is actually named `inv`.

- **`from scipy.linalg import inv as my_inv`**: This imports the `inv` function from `scipy.linalg` and renames it to `my_inv`. This allows you to use `my_inv([[1,2], [3,4]])` without any error.
