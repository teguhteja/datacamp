# Multiple arguments

Multiple arguments
In the previous exercise, you identified optional arguments by viewing the documentation with help(). You'll now apply this to change the behavior of the sorted() function.

Have a look at the documentation of sorted() by typing help(sorted) in the IPython Shell.

You'll see that sorted() takes three arguments: iterable, key, and reverse. In this exercise, you'll only have to specify iterable and reverse, not key.

Two lists have been created for you.

Can you paste them together and sort them in descending order?

Instructions
100 XP
Use + to merge the contents of first and second into a new list: full.
Call sorted() and on full and specify the reverse argument to be True. Save the sorted list as full_sorted.
Finish off by printing out full_sorted.



# Create lists first and second
first = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0]
second = [10.75, 9.50]

# Paste together first and second: full
full = ____ + ____

# Sort full in descending order: full_sorted
full_sorted = ____

# Print out full_sorted
____
