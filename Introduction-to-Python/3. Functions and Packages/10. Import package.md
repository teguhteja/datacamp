Let's say you wanted to calculate the circumference and area of a circle. Here's what those formulas look like:


Rather than typing the number for pi, you can use the math package that contains the number

For reference, ** is the symbol for exponentiation. For example 3**4 is 3 to the power of 4 and will give 81.

Import the math package.
Use math.pi to calculate the circumference of the circle and store it in C.
Use math.pi to calculate the area of the circle and store it in A.

# Import the math package
import ____

# Calculate C
C = 2 * 0.43 * ____

# Calculate A
A = ____ * 0.43 ** 2

print("Circumference: " + str(C))
print("Area: " + str(A))

Hereâ€™s how you can use the `math` package to calculate the circumference and area of a circle using `math.pi`:

### Complete Code

```python
# Import the math package
import math

# Calculate C (circumference of the circle)
C = 2 * 0.43 * math.pi

# Calculate A (area of the circle)
A = math.pi * 0.43 ** 2

# Print the results
print("Circumference: " + str(C))
print("Area: " + str(A))
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Importing the `math` Package**:
   - `import math` imports the `math` package, which contains useful mathematical constants and functions such as `pi`.

2. **Calculating the Circumference**:
   - The formula for circumference is \( C = 2 \times \text{radius} \times \pi \). Using the radius of 0.43, the code calculates this and stores the result in `C`.

3. **Calculating the Area**:
   - The formula for the area of a circle is \( A = \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \). This is calculated and stored in `A`.

4. **Printing the Results**:
   - The results for both the circumference and area are printed using `print()`, with the values converted to strings using `str()` for proper formatting.

### Expected Output

```plaintext
Circumference: 2.701769682087222
Area: 0.5808804816487527
```

### Conclusion

This exercise demonstrates how to use the `math` package to access constants like `pi` and perform mathematical operations such as calculating the circumference and area of a circle.
