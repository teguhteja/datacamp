# Your First NumPy Array

Your First NumPy Array
You're now going to dive into the world of baseball. Along the way, you'll get comfortable with the basics of numpy, a powerful package to do data science.

A list baseball has already been defined in the Python script, representing the height of some baseball players in centimeters. Can you add some code to create a numpy array from it?

Instructions

Import the numpy package as np, so that you can refer to numpy with np.
Use np.array() to create a numpy array from baseball. Name this array np_baseball.
Print out the type of np_baseball to check that you got it right.

# Import the numpy package as np


baseball = [180, 215, 210, 210, 188, 176, 209, 200]

# Create a numpy array from baseball: np_baseball


# Print out type of np_baseball

Here is the Python code to complete the task:

```python
# Import the numpy package as np
import numpy as np

# List of baseball heights
baseball = [180, 215, 210, 210, 188, 176, 209, 200]

# Create a numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out type of np_baseball
print(type(np_baseball))
```

### Explanation:
1. We first import the `numpy` package using the alias `np`.
2. The list `baseball` contains the heights of baseball players in centimeters.
3. Using `np.array()`, we convert the list `baseball` into a numpy array named `np_baseball`.
4. Finally, we print out the type of `np_baseball` to confirm it's a numpy array.

Running this code will output:
```
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>
```
