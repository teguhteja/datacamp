# Baseball players' height

Baseball players' height
You are a huge baseball fan. You decide to call the MLB (Major League Baseball) and ask around for some more statistics on the height of the main players. They pass along data on more than a thousand players, which is stored as a regular Python list: height_in. The height is expressed in inches. Can you make a numpy array out of it and convert the units to meters?

height_in is already available and the numpy package is loaded, so you can start straight away (Source: stat.ucla.edu).

Create a numpy array from height_in. Name this new array np_height_in.
Print np_height_in.
Multiply np_height_in with 0.0254 to convert all height measurements from inches to meters. Store the new values in a new array, np_height_m.
Print out np_height_m and check if the output makes sense.

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create a numpy array from height_in: np_height_in


# Print out np_height_in


# Convert np_height_in to m: np_height_m


# Print np_height_m

Hereâ€™s the Python code to solve the task:

```python
# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Assuming height_in is a pre-existing list of heights in inches
height_in = [65, 70, 72, 74, 68, 73, 69, 75]

# Create a numpy array from height_in: np_height_in
np_height_in = np.array(height_in)

# Print out np_height_in
print("Height in inches:", np_height_in)

# Convert np_height_in to meters: np_height_m
np_height_m = np_height_in * 0.0254

# Print np_height_m
print("Height in meters:", np_height_m)
```

### Explanation:
1. We start by importing `numpy` as `np`.
2. The `height_in` list (provided by the MLB) contains the heights of players in inches.
3. Using `np.array()`, we convert `height_in` to a numpy array called `np_height_in`.
4. We print the original heights in inches (`np_height_in`).
5. We convert the heights to meters by multiplying `np_height_in` by `0.0254` (since 1 inch equals 0.0254 meters) and store the result in `np_height_m`.
6. Finally, we print the array `np_height_m` to see the heights in meters.

### Example Output:
```
Height in inches: [65 70 72 74 68 73 69 75]
Height in meters: [1.651  1.778  1.8288 1.8796 1.7272 1.8542 1.7526 1.905 ]
```

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create a numpy array from height_in: np_height_in
np_height_in = np.array(height_in)

# Print out np_height_in
print(np_height_in)

# Convert np_height_in to m: np_height_m
np_height_m = np_height_in * 0.0254

# Print np_height_m
print(np_height_m)
