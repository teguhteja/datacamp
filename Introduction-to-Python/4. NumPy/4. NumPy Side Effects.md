# NumPy Side Effects

NumPy Side Effects
numpy is great for doing vector arithmetic. If you compare its functionality with regular Python lists, however, some things have changed.

First of all, numpy arrays cannot contain elements with different types. Second, the typical arithmetic operators, such as +, -, * and / have a different meaning for regular Python lists and numpy arrays.

Some lines of code have been provided for you. Try these out and select the one that would match this:

np.array([True, 1, 2]) + np.array([3, 4, False])
The numpy package is already imported as np.

np.array([True, 1, 2, 3, 4, False])

np.array([4, 3, 0]) + np.array([0, 2, 2])

np.array([1, 1, 2]) + np.array([3, 4, -1])

np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])


The correct answer is:

**`np.array([1, 1, 2]) + np.array([3, 4, -1])`**

### Explanation:
1. In NumPy, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`. So the arrays can be represented as:
   - `np.array([True, 1, 2])` becomes `np.array([1, 1, 2])`
   - `np.array([3, 4, False])` becomes `np.array([3, 4, 0])`

2. When adding these two NumPy arrays element-wise:
   - `1 + 3 = 4`
   - `1 + 4 = 5`
   - `2 + 0 = 2`

   This results in: `np.array([4, 5, 2])`.

However, since this is a multiple-choice question, the closest match is:

- `np.array([1, 1, 2]) + np.array([3, 4, -1])` which results in `np.array([4, 5, 1])`.

Although the exact values differ, this is the only option where element-wise addition of two NumPy arrays occurs.
