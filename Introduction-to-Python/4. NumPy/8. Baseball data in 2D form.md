# Baseball data in 2D form

Baseball data in 2D form
You realize that it makes more sense to restructure all this information in a 2D numpy array.

You have a Python list of lists. In this list of lists, each sublist represents the height and weight of a single baseball player. The name of this list is baseball and it has been loaded for you already (although you can't see it).

Store the data as a 2D array to unlock numpy's extra functionality.

Instructions

Use np.array() to create a 2D numpy array from baseball. Name it np_baseball.
Print out the shape attribute of np_baseball.

import numpy as np

# Create a 2D numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = 

# Print out the shape of np_baseball

import numpy as np

# Create a 2D numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)


# Print out the shape of np_baseball
print("Shape of np_baseball:", np_baseball.shape)
