# 2D Arithmetic

2D Arithmetic
2D numpy arrays can perform calculations element by element, like numpy arrays.

np_baseball is coded for you; it's again a 2D numpy array with 3 columns representing height (in inches), weight (in pounds) and age (in years). baseball is available as a regular list of lists and updated is available as 2D numpy array.

Instructions

You managed to get hold of the changes in height, weight and age of all baseball players. It is available as a 2D numpy array, updated. Add np_baseball and updated and print out the result.
You want to convert the units of height and weight to metric (meters and kilograms, respectively). As a first step, create a numpy array with three values: 0.0254, 0.453592 and 1. Name this array conversion.
Multiply np_baseball with conversion and print out the result.

import numpy as np

np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out addition of np_baseball and updated


# Create numpy array: conversion


# Print out product of np_baseball and conversion
