# Subsetting 2D NumPy Arrays

Subsetting 2D NumPy Arrays
If your 2D numpy array has a regular structure, i.e. each row and column has a fixed number of values, complicated ways of subsetting become very easy. Have a look at the code below where the elements "a" and "c" are extracted from a list of lists.

# numpy
import numpy as np
np_x = np.array(x)
np_x[:, 0]
The indexes before the comma refer to the rows, while those after the comma refer to the columns. The : is for slicing; in this example, it tells Python to include all rows.

Print out the 50th row of np_baseball.
Make a new variable, np_weight_lb, containing the entire second column of np_baseball.
Select the height (first column) of the 124th baseball player in np_baseball and print it out.

import numpy as np

np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the 50th row of np_baseball


# Select the entire second column of np_baseball: np_weight_lb


# Print out height of 124th player

np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the 50th row of np_baseball
print("50th row of np_baseball:", np_baseball[49])  # Index 49 for the 50th row

# Select the entire second column of np_baseball: np_weight_lb
np_weight_lb = np_baseball[:, 1]

# Print out np_weight_lb
print("Weights in np_weight_lb:", np_weight_lb)

# Select height (first column) of the 124th baseball player in np_baseball and print it out
height_124th_player = np_baseball[123, 0]  # Index 123 for the 124th player
print("Height of the 124th player:", height_124th_player)
