# Calculations with variables

Other variable types
In the previous exercise, you worked with the integer Python data type:

int, or integer: a number without a fractional part. savings, with the value 100, is an example of an integer.
Next to numerical data types, there are three other very common data types:

float, or floating point: a number that has both an integer and fractional part, separated by a point. 1.1, is an example of a float.
str, or string: a type to represent text. You can use single or double quotes to build a string.
bool, or boolean: a type to represent logical values. It can only be True or False (the capitalization is important!).
Instructions
100 XP
Create a new float, half, with the value 0.5.
Create a new string, intro, with the value "Hello! How are you?".
Create a new boolean, is_good, with the value True.

```py
# Create a variable half


# Create a variable intro


# Create a variable is_good

```

Hereâ€™s the solution based on the instructions:

```py
# Create a variable half
half = 0.5

# Create a variable intro
intro = "Hello! How are you?"

# Create a variable is_good
is_good = True
```

### Explanation:
- We created the variable `half` as a float with the value `0.5`.
- The variable `intro` is a string with the text `"Hello! How are you?"`.
- Finally, the variable `is_good` is a boolean with the value `True`.
