# Other variable types

Operations with other types
Variables come in different types in Python. You can see the type of a variable by using type(). For example, to see type of a, execute: type(a).

Different types behave differently in Python. When you sum two strings, for example, you'll get different behavior than when you sum two integers or two booleans.

Time for you to test this out.

2
Calculate the sum of intro and intro and assign the result to doubleintro.
Print out doubleintro. Did you expect this?

```py
savings = 100
new_savings = 40

# Calculate total_savings using savings and new_savings
____
print(total_savings)

# Print the type of total_savings
print(____)

```

Here’s the solution based on the instructions:

### Part 1:
```py
savings = 100
new_savings = 40

# Calculate total_savings using savings and new_savings
total_savings = savings + new_savings
print(total_savings)

# Print the type of total_savings
print(type(total_savings))
```

### Part 2:
```py
intro = "Hello! How are you?"

# Calculate doubleintro by concatenating intro with itself
doubleintro = intro + intro

# Print doubleintro
print(doubleintro)
```

### Explanation:
- **Part 1**: 
  - We calculated `total_savings` by adding the integer values of `savings` and `new_savings`. 
  - Using `type()` on `total_savings` will print `<class 'int'>`, since both values are integers.
  
- **Part 2**:
  - We concatenated the string `intro` with itself to create `doubleintro`. 
  - When you sum two strings in Python, they get concatenated, so the output will be `"Hello! How are you?Hello! How are you?"`. 

The behavior for summing integers and strings differs—integers are added mathematically, while strings are concatenated.
