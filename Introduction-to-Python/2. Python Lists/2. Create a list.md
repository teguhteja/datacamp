# Create a list

Create a list
A list is a compound data type; you can group values together, like this:

a = "is"
b = "nice"
my_list = ["my", "list", a, b]
After measuring the height of your family, you decide to collect some information on the house you're living in. The areas of the different parts of your house are stored in separate variables in the exercise.

Create a list, areas, that contains the area of the hallway (hall), kitchen (kit), living room (liv), bedroom (bed) and bathroom (bath), in this order. Use the predefined variables.
Print areas with the print() function.

```py
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50

# Create list areas


# Print areas


```

Hereâ€™s the solution based on the instructions:

```py
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50

# Create list areas
areas = [hall, kit, liv, bed, bath]

# Print areas
print(areas)
```

### Explanation:
- We created a list `areas` that contains the area values for the hallway, kitchen, living room, bedroom, and bathroom in the order given.
- We then printed the list using the `print()` function. 

The output will be the list of areas: `[11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]`.
