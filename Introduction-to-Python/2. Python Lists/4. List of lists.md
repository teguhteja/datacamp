# List of lists

List of lists
As a data scientist, you'll often be dealing with a lot of data, and it will make sense to group some of this data.

Instead of creating a list containing strings and floats, representing the names and areas of the rooms in your house, you can create a list of lists.

Remember: "hallway" is a string, while hall is a variable that represents the float 11.25 you specified earlier.

Finish the list of lists so that it also contains the bedroom and bathroom data. Make sure you enter these in order!
Print out house; does this way of structuring your data make more sense?

hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50

# House information as list of lists
house = [["hallway", hall],
         ["kitchen", kit],
         ["living room", liv],
        ____,
        ____]

# Print out house
