# Understanding ARG and ENV

Let's evaluate each statement:

1. "Variables set in a Dockerfile using the ARG instruction are not accessible after the image is built. This means it is safe to use ARG to store secrets in a Dockerfile."

This statement is partially correct but misleading. While ARG variables are indeed not accessible after the image is built, it is NOT safe to use ARG to store secrets in a Dockerfile. The values of ARG instructions can still be viewed in the image history, making them unsuitable for secrets.

2. "Variables set using ENV can be used in containers starting from your image, making it a good way to set configuration using a runtime."

This statement is correct. ENV variables persist in the built image and are available to containers at runtime. They are indeed a good way to set configuration that can be used when the container starts.

3. "It is possible to override variables set with ARG during the build, allowing us to configure images at build-time."

This statement is correct. ARG values can be overridden at build time using the `--build-arg` flag with the `docker build` command. This allows for flexible configuration of the image during the build process.

4. "Every user starting a container from our image can select a different value for any ENV variables we set in our image."

This statement is correct. Users can override ENV variables when starting a container using the `-e` flag with the `docker run` command. This allows for runtime configuration of the container.

Therefore, the correct answers are:

2. "Variables set using ENV can be used in containers starting from your image, making it a good way to set configuration using a runtime."
3. "It is possible to override variables set with ARG during the build, allowing us to configure images at build-time."
4. "Every user starting a container from our image can select a different value for any ENV variables we set in our image."
