# Setting the working directory

Certainly! To set the working directory to `/home/repl` in your Dockerfile, you'll use the `WORKDIR` instruction. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the Dockerfile in your current working directory using a text editor. You can use the `nano` editor, which is commonly available:

   ```
   nano Dockerfile
   ```

2. Once the Dockerfile is open, navigate to the fourth line.

3. On the fourth line, add the following instruction:

   ```dockerfile
   WORKDIR /home/repl
   ```

4. After adding this line, your Dockerfile should look something like this:

   ```dockerfile
   FROM ubuntu:22.04
   RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash repl
   USER repl
   WORKDIR /home/repl
   # ... other instructions ...
   ```

5. Save the changes and exit the editor:
   - If you're using nano, press `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter` to save and exit.

This `WORKDIR /home/repl` instruction sets the working directory for any subsequent instructions in the Dockerfile. It means:

- All following commands will be executed in this directory.
- Any `COPY` or `ADD` instructions will use this as the destination directory unless an absolute path is specified.
- The `CMD` instruction (if present) will use this as its working directory.

This change clearly indicates that all pipeline project files in your image will be in the repl user's home directory, as you intended. It's a good practice for organizing your container's filesystem and making your Dockerfile more readable and maintainable.
