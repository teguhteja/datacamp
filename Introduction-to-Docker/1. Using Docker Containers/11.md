Cleaning up images
The project you were working on is done. You had to use and try several docker containers and images and would like to clear up some space on your system before starting your next project. You remember using the ubuntu image last and know you won't need it for your next project.

Using the terminal, enter the command to remove the ubuntu image.

The ubuntu image failed to remove since it still has a container using it. To be sure you can clean up your images, remove all stopped containers.

Now that all stopped containers are removed, also remove all unused images.

Certainly! I'll guide you through the process of cleaning up your Docker environment step by step.

Step 1: Remove the ubuntu image

First, let's try to remove the ubuntu image:

```bash
docker rmi ubuntu
```

However, this command will fail if there are any containers (running or stopped) that are using this image.

Step 2: Remove all stopped containers

Since the image removal failed, we need to remove all stopped containers first. Use this command:

```bash
docker container prune
```

This command will remove all stopped containers. Docker will ask for confirmation before proceeding. Type 'y' and press Enter to confirm.

Step 3: Remove all unused images

Now that we've removed all stopped containers, we can remove all unused images, including the ubuntu image:

```bash
docker image prune -a
```

The `-a` flag tells Docker to remove all unused images, not just dangling ones. Again, Docker will ask for confirmation. Type 'y' and press Enter to confirm.

This command will remove all images that aren't associated with a container, freeing up space on your system.

After these steps, you should have successfully:
1. Attempted to remove the ubuntu image (which failed initially)
2. Removed all stopped containers
3. Removed all unused images, including ubuntu

Your Docker environment should now be cleaned up and ready for your next project. Remember, if you need any of these images in the future, you can always pull them again from Docker Hub.
