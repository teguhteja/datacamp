Cleaning up containers
You were able to find the issue with your colleague's container and help him fix it. Before you return to your project, you want to clean up the container you just started to help your colleague.

Now that the container is stopped use the terminal to remove the container.

Certainly! I'll guide you through the process of stopping and removing the colleague_project container. This is a good practice to clean up resources when you're done with a container.

Step 1: Stop the colleague_project container

To stop the running container named colleague_project, use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
docker stop colleague_project
```

This command tells Docker to send a SIGTERM signal to the main process running in the container, giving it time to shut down gracefully. If the process doesn't stop within a default timeout period (usually 10 seconds), Docker will forcefully kill it with a SIGKILL signal.

Step 2: Remove the stopped container

Now that the container is stopped, you can remove it using the following command:

```bash
docker rm colleague_project
```

This command removes the stopped container. The container must be stopped before it can be removed, which is why we performed the stop operation first.

After running these two commands, the colleague_project container will be completely removed from your system, freeing up resources.

If you want to combine these steps into a single command, you could use:

```bash
docker rm -f colleague_project
```

The `-f` (or `--force`) flag tells Docker to stop the container if it's running and then remove it. However, it's generally safer to stop and remove separately as it allows for a more graceful shutdown.

Remember, removing a container deletes its writable layer, so make sure you've saved any important data from the container before removing it. The image used to create the container remains intact and can be used to start a new container if needed.
