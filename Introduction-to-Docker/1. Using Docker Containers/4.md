An interactive container
Another bug has popped up in the data ingestion pipeline; this time, however, you got some pointers on where the issue might be. Your colleagues tell you the application cannot start inside its Ubuntu container. To debug the issue you want to start an Ubuntu container and try to run the application yourself to find out what's going wrong.

Select the right combination of commands to:

Run an ubuntu container and get an interactive shell inside of the container.
Close the container to go back to the host after you got an interactive shell in the container and found the issue with the pipeline.
You can use the shell to try out the possible commands.

docker run -it ubuntu and stop

docker run ubuntu -it and stop

docker run ubuntu -shell and exit

docker run -it ubuntu and exit

Based on the requirements and the options provided, the correct combination of commands to run an Ubuntu container interactively and then exit it is:

docker run -it ubuntu and exit

Let's break this down:

1. To run an Ubuntu container and get an interactive shell:
   `docker run -it ubuntu`

   - `docker run` creates and starts a new container
   - `-it` is a combination of two flags:
     - `-i` keeps STDIN open even if not attached
     - `-t` allocates a pseudo-TTY
   - `ubuntu` is the name of the image to use

   This command will start an Ubuntu container and immediately give you a shell prompt inside the container.

2. To close the container and return to the host:
   Once you're inside the container and have finished your debugging, you can simply type `exit` at the shell prompt.

   The `exit` command will close the shell and stop the container, returning you to your host system's shell.

This combination allows you to:
1. Start an Ubuntu container with an interactive shell
2. Investigate and debug your application within the Ubuntu environment
3. Exit the container when you're done, returning to your host system

The other options are incorrect because:
- `stop` is a separate Docker command used to stop a running container from outside, not from within the container's shell.
- `-shell` is not a valid Docker flag.
- The order in `docker run ubuntu -it` is incorrect; the flags should come before the image name.

Therefore, "docker run -it ubuntu and exit" is the correct answer for this scenario.
