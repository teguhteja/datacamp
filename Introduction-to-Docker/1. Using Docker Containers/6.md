Helping a colleague
You're working on a project of your own and have quite a few containers running when your colleague asks you to debug an issue he's having. You've got some time to help your colleague, but you want to make sure you can find his container among all the ones you already have running.

Using the terminal, enter the command to run the my_project image detached from your shell while giving it the colleague_project name.
To run an image in detached mode use the -d flag, without using this flag the image will run connected to your shell making it unusable. If this happens you can refresh the page.

The container should be running now. Make sure it is by filtering the running containers using the name colleague_project you gave the container.

Now that you're sure the container is running look at the logs using the container's name, colleague_project.

Certainly! I'll guide you through each step to help you run your colleague's project container and verify its status.

Step 1: Run the my_project image detached with a specific name

To run the my_project image detached from your shell and give it the name colleague_project, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name colleague_project my_project
```

This command does the following:
- `docker run` creates and starts a new container
- `-d` runs the container in detached mode (in the background)
- `--name colleague_project` assigns the name "colleague_project" to the container
- `my_project` is the name of the image to use

Step 2: Filter running containers by name

To verify that the container is running and to filter the list to show only the colleague_project container, use this command:

```bash
docker ps --filter name=colleague_project
```

This command will list all running containers, but the `--filter` option will ensure that only containers with the name "colleague_project" are shown.

Step 3: View the logs of the container

To view the logs of the colleague_project container, use the following command:

```bash
docker logs colleague_project
```

This command will display the logs output by the container since it started running.

By following these steps, you've successfully:
1. Started your colleague's project in a detached container with a specific name
2. Verified that the container is running by filtering the container list
3. Viewed the logs of the container to help with debugging

Remember, if you need to stop the container later, you can use `docker stop colleague_project`. If you need to remove it, use `docker rm colleague_project` (you may need to stop it first if it's still running).
