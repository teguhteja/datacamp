Certainly! I'll guide you through the process of checking your available images and then pulling the specific version of Ubuntu that your colleague is using.

Step 1: See all available images

To see all images available on your machine, use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
docker images
```

This command will list all the Docker images you have locally, showing information like the repository name, tag, image ID, creation date, and size.

Step 2: Pull the specific Ubuntu version

Now that you've confirmed you don't have the same version as your colleague, let's pull the Ubuntu 22.04 image. Use the following command:

```bash
docker pull ubuntu:22.04
```

This command does the following:
- `docker pull` tells Docker to download an image
- `ubuntu` is the name of the image repository
- `:22.04` is the specific tag we want to pull, corresponding to Ubuntu version 22.04

After running this command, you should see output indicating that Docker is downloading the layers for Ubuntu 22.04. Once it's complete, you'll see a message confirming the successful download.

You can verify that you now have this specific version by running `docker images` again. You should see an entry for `ubuntu` with the tag `22.04`.

Now you have the same Ubuntu version as your colleague, which should help you reproduce and debug the issue more accurately. Remember, when you want to run a container with this specific version, you would use:

```bash
docker run ubuntu:22.04
```

This ensures you're using the exact same base image as your colleague.
