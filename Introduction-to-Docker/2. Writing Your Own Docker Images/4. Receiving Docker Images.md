# Receiving Docker Images

Receiving Docker Images
Your company is still working on that new spam filter! Your colleague Bob made possible improvements to your work and sent you a tar file. Another colleague, Alice, has pushed her version to the company's dockerhub, docker.mycompany.com. It's now up to you to run both containers and find out which runs fastest.

Instructions 1/4

1
Using the terminal, enter the command to pull the container your colleague Alice made, spam_alice:v3, from the company's Docker Hub registry, docker.mycompany.com.


Take Hint (-7 XP)
2
Run the container you just pulled, docker.mycompany.com/spam_alice:v3, to see how good its spam detection algorithm is.

3
Using the terminal, enter the command to open the tar file your colleague Bob sent you, spam_bob.tar.

4
Just like you did for Alice's container, run Bob's container, spam_bob:v3, to see how good its spam detection algorithm is.


Certainly! I'll guide you through each step to pull, load, and run both your colleagues' containers.

Step 1: Pull Alice's container from the company's Docker Hub

To pull Alice's container from your company's Docker Hub, use this command:

```bash
docker pull docker.mycompany.com/spam_alice:v3
```

This command downloads the image `spam_alice:v3` from your company's Docker registry.

Step 2: Run Alice's container

To run Alice's container and see how good its spam detection algorithm is, use:

```bash
docker run docker.mycompany.com/spam_alice:v3
```

This command creates and starts a new container based on Alice's image. The container will run and output the results of its spam detection algorithm.

Step 3: Load Bob's container from the tar file

To load Bob's container from the tar file he sent you, use:

```bash
docker load -i spam_bob.tar
```

This command loads the image from the tar file into your local Docker image store.

Step 4: Run Bob's container

Finally, to run Bob's container and see how good its spam detection algorithm is, use:

```bash
docker run spam_bob:v3
```

This command creates and starts a new container based on Bob's image. The container will run and output the results of its spam detection algorithm.

After completing these steps, you'll have run both Alice's and Bob's spam detection algorithms. You can compare their outputs and performance to determine which one runs fastest and provides the best results.

Remember, if you want to see more detailed information about the running time of each container, you could use the `time` command before each `docker run` command, like this:

```bash
time docker run docker.mycompany.com/spam_alice:v3
time docker run spam_bob:v3
```

This will give you more precise timing information to compare the speed of the two algorithms.
