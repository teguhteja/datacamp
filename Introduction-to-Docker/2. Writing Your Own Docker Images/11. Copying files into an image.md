Copying files into an image
You've created an Ubuntu and python3-based image to run your data pipeline. Update your Dockerfile so your image includes the pipeline.py file in which you defined the pipeline.

To the end of the Dockerfile, add the Docker instruction, which copies the pipeline.py file in your current working directory (/home/repl) to the /app folder in the image you want to build.

Certainly! To copy the pipeline.py file from your current working directory into the /app folder in your Docker image, you'll need to use the COPY instruction in your Dockerfile. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, let's open the Dockerfile in a text editor:

```bash
nano Dockerfile
```

2. Now, add the COPY instruction at the end of your Dockerfile. Your Dockerfile should look something like this:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y python3

# Add this line at the end of your Dockerfile
COPY pipeline.py /app/
```

3. Save and exit the nano editor (CTRL+X, then Y, then Enter).

Let's break down the COPY instruction:

- `COPY` is the Docker instruction to copy files or directories.
- `pipeline.py` is the source file in your current working directory (/home/repl).
- `/app/` is the destination directory in your Docker image.

This instruction tells Docker to copy the pipeline.py file from your build context (the current directory where you're running the docker build command) into the /app directory in your image.

Note: If the /app directory doesn't exist in your image, Docker will create it automatically.

After adding this instruction, when you build your image, the pipeline.py file will be included in the /app directory of your Docker image.

To build your updated image, you can use:

```bash
docker build -t my_pipeline_image .
```

This will create a new image tagged as 'my_pipeline_image' that includes your pipeline.py file in the /app directory.

Remember, the COPY instruction is very useful for including your application code, configuration files, or any other necessary files into your Docker image.
