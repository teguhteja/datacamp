# Overriding the default command

Overriding the default command
Overriding the start command of an image has many uses. One of them is testing or debugging something in an image that already has a start command with a specific use case. For example, the postgres image starts a database if you start it normally. To be able to dive into the image and look at configuration files or debug an issue you're having; you can start it with the bash command, an often available shell. What is the command to start the postgres image interactively with a bash shell?

docker run -it postgres -cmd bash

docker run -it postgres -start bash

docker run -it postgres bash

docker run -it bash postgres

The correct command to start the postgres image interactively with a bash shell is:

```
docker run -it postgres bash
```

Let's break down this command:

1. `docker run`: This is the basic command to run a Docker container.

2. `-it`: These are two flags combined:
   - `-i` or `--interactive`: Keeps STDIN open even if not attached, allowing you to interact with the container.
   - `-t` or `--tty`: Allocates a pseudo-TTY, which is necessary for an interactive shell session.

3. `postgres`: This is the name of the Docker image you want to run.

4. `bash`: This is the command that overrides the default command specified in the Dockerfile. It tells Docker to start a bash shell instead of running the default PostgreSQL server process.

By using this command, you're essentially telling Docker to:
1. Create a new container based on the postgres image
2. Keep it interactive (so you can type commands)
3. Allocate a terminal
4. Run bash instead of the default PostgreSQL process

This allows you to "dive into" the container and explore its filesystem, check configuration files, or perform debugging tasks, all while having an interactive bash shell at your disposal.
