# Building your first image

Building your first image
Let's build your first image! We've created a Dockerfile for you, and you can see it in your current working directory using the ls command. You can look at its content using cat Dockerfile or using nano.

Well done! While it's possible to build an image without naming it, we usually want to give our image a name. Using the terminal, enter the command to build an image called my_first_image from the Dockerfile in your current working directory.

Great! Let's go through the process of building your first Docker image using the provided Dockerfile. We'll do this in two steps: first building without a specific name, and then building with a name.

Step 1: Build an image from the Dockerfile

To build an image from the Dockerfile in your current working directory without specifying a name, use the following command:

```bash
docker build .
```

This command tells Docker to build an image using the Dockerfile in the current directory (represented by the dot `.`). Docker will assign a random ID to this image.

Step 2: Build an image with a specific name

Now, let's build the image again, but this time we'll give it a name. To build an image called `my_first_image` from the Dockerfile in your current working directory, use this command:

```bash
docker build -t my_first_image .
```

Let's break down this command:
- `docker build` is the command to build a new image
- `-t my_first_image` tags the image with the name "my_first_image"
- `.` specifies that the Dockerfile is in the current directory

After running this command, Docker will build the image and tag it with the name "my_first_image".

You can verify that the image was created by running:

```bash
docker images
```

You should see "my_first_image" in the list of images.

Remember, when you're building images, it's a good practice to use descriptive names and version tags. For example, you might use something like:

```bash
docker build -t my_project:v1.0 .
```

This names the image "my_project" and gives it a version tag of "v1.0".

Congratulations on building your first Docker image!
