# Saving an image to a file

Saving an image to a file
After you pushed your image to the company's registry, you got a lot of feedback from your colleagues. You addressed the most important feedback and would like to share your new Docker image, spam:v2, with just a few colleagues before you share it with the entire company again. Save your new Docker image to a file called spam_updated.tar so you can email it to your colleagues Alice and Bob.

Using the terminal, enter the command to save spam:v2 to a file called spam_updated.tar.

Certainly! To save a Docker image to a file, we use the `docker save` command. This command creates a tarball (a .tar file) that contains all the layers of the specified image.

Here's the command you should use to save the `spam:v2` image to a file called `spam_updated.tar`:

```bash
docker save -o spam_updated.tar spam:v2
```

Let's break down this command:

- `docker save` is the command to save one or more images to a tar archive.
- `-o spam_updated.tar` specifies the output file. The `-o` flag is used to specify the name of the output file.
- `spam:v2` is the name and tag of the image you want to save.

After running this command, Docker will create a file named `spam_updated.tar` in your current directory. This file will contain all the layers and metadata of your `spam:v2` image.

Once the command completes, you can verify that the file was created by listing the contents of your current directory:

```bash
ls -l spam_updated.tar
```

You should see the `spam_updated.tar` file listed.

Now you can email this `spam_updated.tar` file to Alice and Bob. They can then load this image into their Docker environments using the `docker load` command:

```bash
docker load -i spam_updated.tar
```

This method allows you to share your Docker image without using a registry, which is useful for limited distribution or when you want to keep the image private.

Remember, Docker image files can be quite large, so make sure you have enough disk space and that your email system can handle attachments of that size. If the file is too large for email, you might consider using a file sharing service instead.
