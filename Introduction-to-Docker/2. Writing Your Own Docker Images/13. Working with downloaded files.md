# Working with downloaded files

Working with downloaded files
Your previous image worked, and you were able to finalize your pipeline python code! You can now create the next version of your image. Let's create a Dockerfile from scratch, add instructions and then build it.

Instructions 1/4
25 XP
1
Create a file called Dockerfile in the current working directory.

Take Hint (-7 XP)
2
Add the first instruction to the Dockerfile so that it will build on top of the ubuntu image.
Add instructions to the Dockerfile so that it runs apt-get update and apt-get install -y python3 curl unzip.
3
Add instructions to the Dockerfile to:

Download the zip file from https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/6082/datasets/31a5052c6a5424cbb8d939a7a6eff9311957e7d0/pipeline_final.zip to /pipeline_final.zip.
Unzip the file
And remove the zip
You can use three separate instructions or make it a single instruction to keep your image smaller.
4
Using the terminal, run the command to build an image called pipeline from the Dockerfile in your current working directory.

Certainly! Let's go through this step-by-step to create a Dockerfile that builds on Ubuntu, installs necessary packages, downloads and extracts the pipeline files, and then builds the image.

Step 1: Create a Dockerfile

First, let's create a new Dockerfile in the current directory:

```bash
touch Dockerfile
```

Step 2: Add the FROM instruction and install packages

Now, let's open the Dockerfile in a text editor and add the necessary instructions:

```bash
nano Dockerfile
```

In the nano editor, add these lines:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 curl unzip
```

Step 3: Add instructions to download, unzip, and remove the zip file

Let's add the instructions to download the zip file, unzip it, and remove the zip. We'll do this in a single RUN instruction to keep the image smaller:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 curl unzip

RUN curl -O https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/6082/datasets/31a5052c6a5424cbb8d939a7a6eff9311957e7d0/pipeline_final.zip && \
    unzip pipeline_final.zip -d / && \
    rm pipeline_final.zip
```

Save and exit nano by pressing CTRL+X, then Y, then Enter.

Step 4: Build the image

Now that we've created our Dockerfile with the necessary instructions, let's build it into a new image called 'pipeline':

```bash
docker build -t pipeline .
```

This command tells Docker to:
- Build an image
- Tag it with the name 'pipeline' (that's what the -t flag does)
- Use the Dockerfile in the current directory (that's what the . at the end means)

After running this command, Docker will process the instructions in your Dockerfile, creating a new image based on Ubuntu with Python3, curl, and unzip installed, and the contents of the pipeline_final.zip file extracted to the root directory.

You can verify that the image was created by running:

```bash
docker images
```

You should see 'pipeline' in the list of images.

Congratulations! You've now created a Dockerfile from scratch, added instructions to install packages, download and extract files, and built it into a new Docker image. This image is ready for you to use in your pipeline project.
