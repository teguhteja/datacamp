# Creating your own Dockerfile

Creating your own Dockerfile
While it's possible to download images for many use cases, an image might not always meet your exact needs. In that case, you can create a new image based on an existing one that closely matches your requirements. Let's go through the steps to create a Dockerfile from scratch, build on top of an existing Ubuntu image, add your instructions, and then build it into a new image.

Instructions 1/4

1
Create a file called Dockerfile in the current working directory.

Take Hint (-7 XP)
2
Add the first instruction to the Dockerfile so that it will build on top of the ubuntu image.
3
Add instructions to the Dockerfile so that it runs apt-get update and apt-get install -y python3 when building the Dockerfile.
4
Using the terminal, run the command to build an image called my_python_image from the Dockerfile in your current working directory.


Certainly! I'll guide you through creating a Dockerfile from scratch, adding the necessary instructions, and then building it into a new image. Let's go through this step-by-step.

Step 1: Create a Dockerfile

First, let's create a new Dockerfile in the current directory:

```bash
touch Dockerfile
```

Step 2: Add the FROM instruction

Now, let's open the Dockerfile in a text editor and add the FROM instruction to base our image on Ubuntu:

```bash
nano Dockerfile
```

In the nano editor, add this line:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
```

Save and exit nano by pressing CTRL+X, then Y, then Enter.

Step 3: Add RUN instructions

Let's add the instructions to update apt-get and install Python3. Reopen the Dockerfile:

```bash
nano Dockerfile
```

Add these lines after the FROM instruction:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y python3
```

Save and exit nano again.

Step 4: Build the image

Now that we've created our Dockerfile with the necessary instructions, let's build it into a new image called 'my_python_image':

```bash
docker build -t my_python_image .
```

This command tells Docker to:
- Build an image
- Tag it with the name 'my_python_image' (that's what the -t flag does)
- Use the Dockerfile in the current directory (that's what the . at the end means)

After running this command, Docker will process the instructions in your Dockerfile, creating a new image based on Ubuntu with Python3 installed.

You can verify that the image was created by running:

```bash
docker images
```

You should see 'my_python_image' in the list of images.

Congratulations! You've now created a Dockerfile from scratch, added instructions to it, and built it into a new Docker image. This image is based on Ubuntu and has Python3 installed, ready for you to use in your Python projects.
