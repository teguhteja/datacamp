The correct answers are:

1. ✅ **Processes that extract, transform, then load data are known as ETL pipelines.**  
   - This is true; ETL stands for "Extract, Transform, Load," where data is extracted from a source, transformed to fit the destination system, and loaded.

3. ✅ **ELT processes are typically found in a data platform that leverages a data warehouse.**  
   - This is also true; ELT stands for "Extract, Load, Transform," and is commonly used in modern data warehouses where data is loaded first and then transformed within the warehouse.
