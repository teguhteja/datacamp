# Creating fixtures with pytest

Creating fixtures with pytest
When building unit tests, you'll sometimes have to do a bit of setup before testing can begin. Doing this setup within a unit test can make the tests more difficult to read, and may have to be repeated several times. Luckily, pytest offers a way to solve these problems, with fixtures.

For this exercise, pandas has been imported as pd, and the extract() function shown below is available for use!

def extract(file_path):
    return pd.read_csv(file_path)
