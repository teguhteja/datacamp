        The benefits of validating a [data pipeline](/home/teguhteja/Project/GithubProjects/datacamp/ETL-and-ELT-in-Python/4. Deploying and Maintaining a Data Pipeline/2. Testing data pipelines.md) during and after development include:

1. Improves reliability and trust in pipelined data
2. Validate that data is extracted, transformed, and loaded as expected
4. Helps to identify and avoid data quality issues

These actions ensure that the pipeline functions correctly and that the data processed is accurate and reliable. Reducing the need for thorough documentation is not a benefit of validating a pipeline, as documentation is still crucial for understanding and maintaining the pipeline.
