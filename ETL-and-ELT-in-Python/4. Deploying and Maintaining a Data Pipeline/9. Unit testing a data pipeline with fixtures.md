# Unit testing a data pipeline with fixtures

Unit testing a data pipeline with fixtures
You've learned in the last video that unit testing can help to instill more trust in your data pipeline, and can even help to catch bugs throughout development. In this exercise, you'll practice writing both fixtures and unit tests, using the pytest library and assert.

The transform function that you'll be building unit tests around is shown below for reference. pandas has been imported as pd, and the pytest() library is loaded and ready for use.

def transform(raw_data):
    raw_data["tax_rate"] = raw_data["total_taxes_paid"] / raw_data["total_taxable_income"]
    raw_data.set_index("industry_name", inplace=True)
    return raw_data

1
Create a pytest fixture called clean_tax_data.
Apply the transform() function to the raw_data dataset, and save the result in the clean_data variable and return it.
# Define a pytest fixture
@pytest.fixture()
____ ____():
    raw_data = pd.read_csv("raw_tax_data.csv")
    
    # Transform the raw_data, store in clean_data DataFrame, and return the variable
    clean_data = ____
    return ____

Here's how you can create a pytest fixture to transform your raw data:

```python
# Define a pytest fixture
@pytest.fixture()
def clean_tax_data():
    raw_data = pd.read_csv("raw_tax_data.csv")
    
    # Transform the raw_data using the transform function and store in clean_data
    clean_data = transform(raw_data)
    
    # Return the clean_data DataFrame
    return clean_data
```

### Explanation:
1. **Fixture Definition**: `@pytest.fixture()` marks `clean_tax_data` as a fixture, so you can use it in your tests.
2. **Applying `transform()`**: The `transform(raw_data)` function is used to process `raw_data`, and the result is assigned to `clean_data`.
3. **Return**: `clean_data` is returned, making the fixture ready for use in unit tests.

2
Create a unit test using the fixture defined from the last step.
Complete the statement that ensures all values in the "tax_rate" column lie within the values 0 and 1.
@pytest.fixture()
def clean_tax_data():
    raw_data = pd.read_csv("raw_tax_data.csv")
    clean_data = transform(raw_data)
    return clean_data

# Pass the fixture to the function
def test_tax_rate(____):
    # Assert values are within the expected range
    assert ____["tax_rate"].____() <= 1 and ____["tax_rate"].____() >= 0

Here's how you can write the unit test using the fixture:

```python
# Pass the fixture to the function
def test_tax_rate(clean_tax_data):
    # Assert values are within the expected range
    assert clean_tax_data["tax_rate"].max() <= 1 and clean_tax_data["tax_rate"].min() >= 0
```

### Explanation:
1. **Passing the Fixture**: `clean_tax_data` is passed to `test_tax_rate` as an argument, providing the transformed DataFrame for testing.
2. **Assertions**: The `max()` and `min()` methods are used to check that all values in the "tax_rate" column lie within the range of 0 to 1.
