# Persisting data to files

Persisting data to files
Loading data to a final destination is one of the most important steps of a data pipeline. In this exercise, you'll use the transform() function shown below to transform product sales data before loading it to a .csv file. This will give downstream data consumers a better view into total sales across a range of products.

For this exercise, the sales data has been loaded and transformed, and is stored in the clean_sales_data DataFrame. The pandas package has been imported as pd, and the os library is also ready to use!

Update the load() function to write data to the provided path, without headers or an index column.
Check to make sure the file was loaded to the desired file path.
Call the function to load the transformed data to persistent storage.

def load(clean_data, file_path):
    # Write the data to a file
    clean_data.to_csv(file_path, ____, ____)

    # Check to make sure the file exists
    file_exists = os.____.____(____)
    if not file_exists:
        raise Exception(f"File does NOT exists at path {file_path}")

# Load the transformed data to the provided file path
____(clean_sales_data, "transformed_sales_data.csv")

```py
def load(clean_data, file_path):
    # Write the data to a file
    clean_data.to_csv(file_path, header=False, index=False)

    # Check to make sure the file exists
    file_exists = os.path.exists(file_path)
    if not file_exists:
        raise Exception(f"File does NOT exists at path {file_path}")

# Load the transformed data to the provided file path
load(clean_sales_data, "transformed_sales_data.csv")


```

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the `load()` function based on your instructions:

1. **Set the correct values for the `header` and `index` parameters in the `.to_csv()` method**.
2. **Use the `os.path.exists()` function to ensure the DataFrame was written correctly**.
3. **Make sure to load the data using the `load()` function**.

```python
import os

def load(clean_data, file_path):
    # Write the data to a file without headers and without the index column
    clean_data.to_csv(file_path, header=False, index=False)

    # Check to make sure the file exists
    file_exists = os.path.exists(file_path)
    if not file_exists:
        raise Exception(f"File does NOT exist at path {file_path}")

# Load the transformed data to the provided file path
load(clean_sales_data, "transformed_sales_data.csv")
```

### Explanation:
- **`header=False, index=False`**: These values ensure that the CSV file is written without column headers or index.
- **`os.path.exists(file_path)`**: Verifies that the file has been written correctly to the specified path. If the file does not exist, it raises an exception.

This version should now correctly fulfill the instructions and persist the data, checking that it was written to the specified file path.
