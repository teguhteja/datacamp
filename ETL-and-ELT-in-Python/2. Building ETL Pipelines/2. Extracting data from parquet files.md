# Extracting data from parquet files

Extracting data from parquet files
One of the most common ways to ingest data from a source system is by reading data from a file, such as a CSV file. As data has gotten bigger, the need for better file formats has brought about new column-oriented file types, such as parquet files.

In this exercise, you'll practice extracting data from a parquet file.

Instructions
100 XP
Read the parquet file at the path "sales_data.parquet" into a pandas DataFrame.
Check the data types of the DataFrame via print()ing.
Output the shape of the DataFrame, as well as it's head.

import pandas as pd

# Read the sales data into a DataFrame
sales_data = pd.____("____", engine="fastparquet")

# Check the data type of the columns of the DataFrames
print(sales_data.____)

# Print the shape of the DataFrame, as well as the head
print(sales_data.____)
print(sales_data.____())

You can fill in the missing parts of your code as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the sales data into a DataFrame
sales_data = pd.read_parquet("sales_data.parquet", engine="fastparquet")

# Check the data type of the columns of the DataFrame
print(sales_data.dtypes)

# Print the shape of the DataFrame, as well as the head
print(sales_data.shape)
print(sales_data.head())
```

### Explanation:
- `pd.read_parquet`: Used to read the parquet file.
- `"sales_data.parquet"`: The path to your parquet file.
- `engine="fastparquet"`: Specifies the engine to use. Other options include `"pyarrow"`.
- `dtypes`: Attribute to display the data types of each column.
- `shape`: Provides the dimensions of the DataFrame.
- `head()`: Shows the first few rows of the DataFrame.
