# Loading sales data to a CSV file

Loading sales data to a CSV file
Loading data is an essential component of any data pipeline. It ensures that any data consumers and processes have reliable access to data that you've extracted and transformed earlier in a pipeline. In this exercise, you'll practice loading transformed sales data to a CSV file using pandas, which has been imported as pd. In addition to this, the raw data has been extracted and is available in the DataFrame raw_sales_data.

Filter the raw_sales_data DataFrame to only keep all items with a price less than 25 dollars.
Update the load() function to write the transformed sales data to a file named "transformed_sales_data.csv", making sure not include the index column.
Call the load() function on the cleaned Data Frame.

def transform(raw_data):
	# Find the items prices less than 25 dollars
	return raw_data.loc[raw_data["Price Each"] ____ ____, ["Order ID", "Product", "Price Each", "Order Date"]]

def load(clean_data):
	# Write the data to a CSV file without the index column
	____.____("transformed_sales_data.csv", index=____)


clean_sales_data = transform(raw_sales_data)

# Call the load function on the cleaned DataFrame
____(____)

Here is how to complete the code for filtering the data and loading it into a CSV file:

```python
def transform(raw_data):
    # Find the items with prices less than 25 dollars
    return raw_data.loc[raw_data["Price Each"] < 25, ["Order ID", "Product", "Price Each", "Order Date"]]

def load(clean_data):
    # Write the data to a CSV file without the index column
    clean_data.to_csv("transformed_sales_data.csv", index=False)

clean_sales_data = transform(raw_sales_data)

# Call the load function on the cleaned DataFrame
load(clean_sales_data)
```

### Explanation:
- **raw_data.loc[raw_data["Price Each"] < 25, ["Order ID", "Product", "Price Each", "Order Date"]]**: Filters the rows where the "Price Each" is less than 25 and selects the specified columns.
- **clean_data.to_csv("transformed_sales_data.csv", index=False)**: Writes the cleaned data to a CSV file named `"transformed_sales_data.csv"`, making sure not to include the index column (`index=False`).

This will save the transformed data into the specified CSV file.
