# Customizing a CSV file

Customizing a CSV file
Sometimes, data needs to be stored in a CSV file in a customized manner. This may include using different header values, including or excluding the index column of a DataFrame, or altering the character used to separate columns. In this example, you'll get to practice this, as well as ensuring that the file is stored in the desired file path.

The pandas library has been imported as pd, and the data has already been transformed to include only rows with a "Quantity Ordered" greater than one. The cleaned DataFrame is stored in a variable named clean_sales_data.

Import the os library.
Write the cleaned DataFrame to a CSV stored at path_to_write, without a header.
Ensure the file was written to the desired path.

# Import the os library
____

# Load the data to a csv file with the index, no header and pipe separated
def load(clean_data, path_to_write):
	clean_data.____(____, header=____, sep="|")

load(clean_sales_data, "clean_sales_data.csv")

# Check that the file is present.
file_exists = os.____.____(____)
print(file_exists)

Hereâ€™s how to complete the code for customizing the CSV file and ensuring it is saved to the desired path:

```python
# Import the os library
import os

# Load the data to a CSV file with the index, no header, and pipe-separated
def load(clean_data, path_to_write):
    clean_data.to_csv(path_to_write, header=False, sep="|", index=True)

load(clean_sales_data, "clean_sales_data.csv")

# Check that the file is present
file_exists = os.path.exists("clean_sales_data.csv")
print(file_exists)
```

### Explanation:
- **import os**: Imports the `os` library, which is useful for file and directory operations.
- **clean_data.to_csv(path_to_write, header=False, sep="|", index=True)**: Writes the cleaned data to a CSV file, using a pipe (`|`) separator, without writing the header (`header=False`), and includes the index (`index=True`).
- **os.path.exists("clean_sales_data.csv")**: Checks if the file exists at the specified path and returns `True` if it does.

This will save the file as `clean_sales_data.csv` and verify that the file was created successfully.
