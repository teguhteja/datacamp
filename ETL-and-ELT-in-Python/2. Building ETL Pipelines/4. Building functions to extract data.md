# Building functions to extract data

Building functions to extract data
It's important to modularize code when building a data pipeline. This helps to make pipelines more readable and reusable, and can help to expedite troubleshooting efforts. Creating and using functions for distinct operations in a pipeline can even help when getting started on a new project by providing a framework to begin development.

pandas has been imported as pd, and sqlalchemy is ready to be used.

1
Complete the connection URI with username "repl", port 5432 and database "sales".
Pass the URI to the appropriate sqlalchemy function to create a connection engine.

def extract():
  	# Create a connection URI and connection engine
    connection_uri = "postgresql+psycopg2://____:password@localhost:____/____"
    db_engine = sqlalchemy.____(connection_uri)

You can complete the `extract` function as follows:

```python
def extract():
    # Create a connection URI and connection engine
    connection_uri = "postgresql+psycopg2://repl:password@localhost:5432/sales"
    db_engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(connection_uri)
    return db_engine
```

### Explanation:
- **connection_uri**: The URI is constructed with `postgresql+psycopg2://repl:password@localhost:5432/sales`:
  - **"repl"**: The username for the database.
  - **5432**: The port number for the PostgreSQL server.
  - **"sales"**: The name of the database.
- **sqlalchemy.create_engine**: This function creates the database connection engine, which will be used for querying the database.

2
Use pandas to query the sales tables for all columns and records with "quantity_ordered" equal to 1.
def extract():
    connection_uri = "postgresql+psycopg2://repl:password@localhost:5432/sales"
    db_engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(connection_uri)
    
    # Query the DataFrame to return all records with quantity_ordered equal to 1
    raw_sales_data = pd.____("____ * FROM sales ____", db_engine)

You can complete the `extract` function for querying the sales data as follows:

```python
def extract():
    connection_uri = "postgresql+psycopg2://repl:password@localhost:5432/sales"
    db_engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(connection_uri)
    
    # Query the DataFrame to return all records with quantity_ordered equal to 1
    raw_sales_data = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM sales WHERE quantity_ordered = 1", db_engine)
    return raw_sales_data
```

### Explanation:
- **pd.read_sql**: Used to execute a SQL query and return the result as a DataFrame.
- `"SELECT * FROM sales WHERE quantity_ordered = 1"`: Queries all records from the `sales` table where the `quantity_ordered` column is equal to 1.

3
Print the head of the DataFrame, and return the extracted data. Then, execute the extract() function.
def extract():
    connection_uri = "postgresql+psycopg2://repl:password@localhost:5432/sales"
    db_engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(connection_uri)
    raw_data = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM sales WHERE quantity_ordered = 1", db_engine)
    
    # Print the head of the DataFrame
    print(____)
    
    # Return the extracted DataFrame
    return ____
    
# Call the extract() function
raw_sales_data = ____
