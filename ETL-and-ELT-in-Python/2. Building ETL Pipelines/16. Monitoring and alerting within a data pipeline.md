# Monitoring and alerting within a data pipeline

Monitoring and alerting within a data pipeline
It's time to put it all together! You might have guessed it, but using handling errors using try-except and logging go hand-in-hand. These two practices are essential for a pipeline to be resilient and transparent, and are the building blocks for more advanced monitoring and alerting solutions.

pandas has been imported as pd, and the logging module has been loaded and configured for you. The raw_sales_data DataFrame has been extracted, and is ready to be transformed.

Create an info-level logging message to document success, and a warning-level logging message if the transformation fails.
def transform(raw_data):
	return raw_data.loc[raw_data["Total Price"] > 1000, :]

try:
	# Attempt to transform DataFrame, log an info-level message
	clean_sales_data = transform(raw_sales_data)
	logging.____("Successfully filtered DataFrame by 'Total Price'")
	
except Exception:
	# Log a warning-level message
	____.____("Cannot filter DataFrame by 'Total Price'")

```py
def transform(raw_data):
	return raw_data.loc[raw_data["Total Price"] > 1000, :]

try:
	# Attempt to transform DataFrame, log an info-level message
	clean_sales_data = transform(raw_sales_data)
	logging.info("Successfully filtered DataFrame by 'Total Price'")
	
except Exception:
	# Log a warning-level message
	logging.warning("Cannot filter DataFrame by 'Total Price'")
```


2
Update the try-except clause to catch a KeyError, and alias as ke.
Change the warning-level log to include the error being thrown.
def transform(raw_data):
	return raw_data.loc[raw_data["Total Price"] > 1000, :]

try:
	clean_sales_data = transform(raw_sales_data)
	logging.info("Successfully filtered DataFrame by 'Total Price'")
	
# Update the exception to be a KeyError, alias as ke
except ____ as ____:
	# Log a warning-level message
	logging.warning(f"{____}: Cannot filter DataFrame by 'Total Price'")

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of your code with the `ke` (aliased error) passed into the warning message:

```python
def transform(raw_data):
    return raw_data.loc[raw_data["Total Price"] > 1000, :]

try:
    clean_sales_data = transform(raw_sales_data)
    logging.info("Successfully filtered DataFrame by 'Total Price'")

# Catching KeyError and aliasing it as ke
except KeyError as ke:
    # Log a warning-level message including the aliased error (ke)
    logging.warning(f"{ke}: Cannot filter DataFrame by 'Total Price'")
```

### Update:
- The warning message now correctly includes `ke` in the string. This ensures the specific `KeyError` is logged with its message when the exception is caught.

3
If a key error is thrown, create a column "Total Price" by multiplying the "Price Each" and "Quantity Ordered" columns.
def transform(raw_data):
	return raw_data.loc[raw_data["Total Price"] > 1000, :]

try:
	clean_sales_data = transform(raw_sales_data)
	logging.info("Successfully filtered DataFrame by 'Total Price'")

except KeyError as ke:
	logging.warning(f"{ke}: Cannot filter DataFrame by 'Total Price'")
	
	# Create the "Total Price" column, transform the updated DataFrame
	raw_sales_data["Total Price"] = ____["Price Each"] * ____["Quantity Ordered"]
	clean_sales_data = transform(raw_sales_data)

Here is the updated code where the `KeyError` handling includes the creation of the "Total Price" column by multiplying "Price Each" and "Quantity Ordered" when the key is missing:

```python
def transform(raw_data):
    return raw_data.loc[raw_data["Total Price"] > 1000, :]

try:
    clean_sales_data = transform(raw_sales_data)
    logging.info("Successfully filtered DataFrame by 'Total Price'")

except KeyError as ke:
    logging.warning(f"{ke}: Cannot filter DataFrame by 'Total Price'")

    # Create the "Total Price" column by multiplying "Price Each" and "Quantity Ordered"
    raw_sales_data["Total Price"] = raw_sales_data["Price Each"] * raw_sales_data["Quantity Ordered"]

    # Transform the updated DataFrame
    clean_sales_data = transform(raw_sales_data)
```

### Explanation of changes:
- When a `KeyError` occurs, the code now creates the "Total Price" column by multiplying the "Price Each" and "Quantity Ordered" columns.
- After the new column is created, it proceeds to call the `transform` function on the updated DataFrame (`raw_sales_data`).
