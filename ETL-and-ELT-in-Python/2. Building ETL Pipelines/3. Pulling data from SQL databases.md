# Pulling data from SQL databases

Pulling data from SQL databases
SQL databases are one of the most used data storage tools in the world. Many companies have teams of several individuals responsible for creating and maintaining these databases, which typically store data crucial for day-to-day operations. These SQL databases are commonly used as source systems for a wide range of data pipelines.

For this exercise, pandas has been imported as pd. Best of luck!

Update the connection URI to create a connection engine for the sales database, using sqlalchemy.
Query all rows and columns of the sales table and output the results.

import sqlalchemy

# Create a connection to the sales database
db_engine = sqlalchemy.____("postgresql+psycopg2://repl:password@localhost:5432/____")

# Query the sales table
raw_sales_data = pd.____("____", db_engine)
print(raw_sales_data)

Here's how you can complete the code to pull data from an SQL database using `sqlalchemy`:

```python
import sqlalchemy
import pandas as pd

# Create a connection to the sales database
db_engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine("postgresql+psycopg2://repl:password@localhost:5432/sales")

# Query the sales table
raw_sales_data = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM sales", db_engine)
print(raw_sales_data)
```

### Explanation:
- `sqlalchemy.create_engine`: Used to create a connection engine to the specified SQL database.
- `"postgresql+psycopg2://repl:password@localhost:5432/sales"`: 
  - `postgresql+psycopg2`: Specifies the database dialect and driver.
  - `repl:password`: Replace with the appropriate username and password.
  - `localhost:5432`: The host and port of the database server.
  - `sales`: The name of the database.
- `pd.read_sql`: Reads SQL query results into a DataFrame.
- `"SELECT * FROM sales"`: Queries all columns and rows from the `sales` table.
