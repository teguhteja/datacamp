# Filling missing values with pandas

Filling missing values with pandas
When building data pipelines, it's inevitable that you'll stumble upon missing data. In some cases, you may want to remove these records from the dataset. But in others, you'll need to impute values for the missing information. In this exercise, you'll practice using pandas to impute missing test scores.

Data from the file "testing_scores.json" has been read into a DataFrame, and is stored in the variable raw_testing_scores. In addition to this, pandas has been loaded as pd.

1
Print the head of the raw_testing_scores DataFrame, and observe the NaN values.
# Print the head of the `raw_testing_scores` DataFrame
print(raw_testing_scores.____)

To print the head of the DataFrame and observe the NaN values, you should use the `.head()` method. Here's how to do it:

```python
# Print the head of the `raw_testing_scores` DataFrame
print(raw_testing_scores.head())
```

This will display the first few rows of `raw_testing_scores` and allow you to identify where the NaN values are located.


2
Use the average of the "math_score" column to fill the NaN values in the "math_score" column.
Print the head of the updated DataFrame.

# Fill NaN values with the average from that column
raw_testing_scores["math_score"] = raw_testing_scores["math_score"].____(raw_testing_scores["math_score"].mean())

# Print the head of the raw_testing_scores DataFrame
print(____)

To fill the NaN values with the average of the `math_score` column, you can use the `fillna()` method, passing the mean value of the column. Here's the updated code:

```python
# Fill NaN values with the average from that column
raw_testing_scores["math_score"] = raw_testing_scores["math_score"].fillna(raw_testing_scores["math_score"].mean())

# Print the head of the raw_testing_scores DataFrame
print(raw_testing_scores.head())
```

This will replace all the NaN values in the `math_score` column with the mean of that column, and then print the first few rows of the updated DataFrame.

3
For the "math_score", "reading_score" and "writing_score" columns, update the transform() function to fill NaN values with the mean of the respective columns, in place.
Print the head of the cleaned DataFrame.

def transform(raw_data):
	raw_data.fillna(
    	value={
			# Fill NaN values with column mean
			"math_score": raw_data["____"].____(),
			"reading_score": ____,
			"writing_score": ____
		}, inplace=True
	)
	return raw_data

clean_testing_scores = transform(raw_testing_scores)

# Print the head of the clean_testing_scores DataFrame
____
To fill NaN values for the `"math_score"`, `"reading_score"`, and `"writing_score"` columns with the mean of each respective column, you can use the `mean()` method for each column in the `value` dictionary of the `fillna()` function.

Hereâ€™s the updated function:

```python
def transform(raw_data):
    raw_data.fillna(
        value={
            # Fill NaN values with column mean
            "math_score": raw_data["math_score"].mean(),
            "reading_score": raw_data["reading_score"].mean(),
            "writing_score": raw_data["writing_score"].mean()
        }, inplace=True
    )
    return raw_data

clean_testing_scores = transform(raw_testing_scores)

# Print the head of the clean_testing_scores DataFrame
print(clean_testing_scores.head())
```

This code will fill the NaN values in the specified columns with the mean of each column and then print the first few rows of the cleaned DataFrame.
