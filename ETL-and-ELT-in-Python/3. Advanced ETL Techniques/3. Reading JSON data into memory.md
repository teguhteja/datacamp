# Reading JSON data into memory

Reading JSON data into memory
When data is stored in JSON format, it's not always easy to load into a DataFrame. This is the case for the "nested_testing_scores.json" file. Here, the data will have to be manually manipulated before it can be stored in a DataFrame.

To help get you started, pandas has been loaded into the workspace as pd.

Use pandas to read a JSON file into a DataFrame.
Pass the "nested_scores.json" file path to the extract() function.
def extract(file_path):
  	# Read the JSON file into a DataFrame, orient by index
	return pd.____(file_path, orient="index")

# Call the extract function, pass in the desired file_path
raw_testing_scores = ____("____")
print(raw_testing_scores.head())

Hereâ€™s how you can modify the `extract` function to read the JSON file into a pandas DataFrame oriented by index:

```python
import pandas as pd

def extract(file_path):
    # Read the JSON file into a DataFrame, orient by index
    return pd.read_json(file_path, orient="index")

# Call the extract function, pass in the desired file_path
raw_testing_scores = extract("nested_scores.json")

# Output the head of the DataFrame
print(raw_testing_scores.head())
```

### Explanation:
- `pd.read_json(file_path, orient="index")`: This reads the JSON file, treating the keys as index labels for the resulting DataFrame.
- `head()`: Displays the first few rows of the DataFrame.

Import the json library.
Use the json library to load the "nested_scores.json" file into memory.
# Import the json library
import ____

def extract(file_path):
    with open(file_path, "r") as json_file:
        # Load the data from the JSON file
        raw_data = json.____(____)
    return raw_data

raw_testing_scores = extract("nested_scores.json")

# Print the raw_testing_scores
print(____)

Here's how you can use the `json` library to load the JSON file into memory:

```python
# Import the json library
import json

def extract(file_path):
    with open(file_path, "r") as json_file:
        # Load the data from the JSON file
        raw_data = json.load(json_file)
    return raw_data

# Call the extract function, passing in the file path
raw_testing_scores = extract("nested_scores.json")

# Print the raw_testing_scores
print(raw_testing_scores)
```

### Explanation:
- `import json`: Imports the `json` library to work with JSON data.
- `json.load(json_file)`: Loads the JSON data from the file into a Python dictionary.
- `print(raw_testing_scores)`: Outputs the raw data for inspection.
