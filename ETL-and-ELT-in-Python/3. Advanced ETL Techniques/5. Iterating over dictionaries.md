# Iterating over dictionaries

Iterating over dictionaries
Once JSON data is loaded into a dictionary, you can leverage Python's built-in tools to iterate over its keys and values.

The "nested_school_scores.json" file has been read into a dictionary stored in the raw_testing_scores variable, which takes the following form:

{
    "01M539": {
        "street_address": "111 Columbia Street",
        "city": "Manhattan",
        "scores": {
              "math": 657,
              "reading": 601,
              "writing": 601
        }
  }, ...
}

Loop through the keys of the raw_testing_scores dictionary.
Add each key to the raw_testing_scores_keys list.

raw_testing_scores_keys = []

# Iterate through the keys of the raw_testing_scores dictionary
for school_id in raw_testing_scores.____():
  	# Append each key to the raw_testing_scores_keys list
	raw_testing_scores_keys.append(____)
    
print(raw_testing_scores_keys[0:3])

Here’s how you can iterate over the keys of the `raw_testing_scores` dictionary and store them in a list:

```python
raw_testing_scores_keys = []

# Iterate through the keys of the raw_testing_scores dictionary
for school_id in raw_testing_scores.keys():
    # Append each key to the raw_testing_scores_keys list
    raw_testing_scores_keys.append(school_id)
    
# Print the first three keys
print(raw_testing_scores_keys[0:3])
```

### Explanation:
- `raw_testing_scores.keys()`: Retrieves all the keys from the `raw_testing_scores` dictionary.
- `append(school_id)`: Adds each key to the `raw_testing_scores_keys` list.
- `print(raw_testing_scores_keys[0:3])`: Prints the first three keys in the list.

Now, loop through a list of values from the raw_testing_scores dictionary.
raw_testing_scores_values = []

# Iterate through the values of the raw_testing_scores dictionary
for school_info in raw_testing_scores.____():
	raw_testing_scores_values.append(school_info)
    
print(raw_testing_scores_values[0:3])
Here’s how you can iterate over the values of the `raw_testing_scores` dictionary and store them in a list:

```python
raw_testing_scores_values = []

# Iterate through the values of the raw_testing_scores dictionary
for school_info in raw_testing_scores.values():
    raw_testing_scores_values.append(school_info)
    
# Print the first three values
print(raw_testing_scores_values[0:3])
```

### Explanation:
- `raw_testing_scores.values()`: Retrieves all the values from the `raw_testing_scores` dictionary.
- `append(school_info)`: Adds each value to the `raw_testing_scores_values` list.
- `print(raw_testing_scores_values[0:3])`: Prints the first three values in the list.

Finally, loop through both the keys and values of the raw_testing_scores dictionary, simultaneously.
raw_testing_scores_keys = []
raw_testing_scores_values = []

# Iterate through the values of the raw_testing_scores dictionary
for school_id, school_info in raw_testing_scores.____():
	raw_testing_scores_keys.append(school_id)
	raw_testing_scores_values.append(school_info)

print(raw_testing_scores_keys[0:3])
print(raw_testing_scores_values[0:3])

Here's how you can loop through both the keys and values of the `raw_testing_scores` dictionary simultaneously:

```python
raw_testing_scores_keys = []
raw_testing_scores_values = []

# Iterate through both the keys and values of the raw_testing_scores dictionary
for school_id, school_info in raw_testing_scores.items():
    raw_testing_scores_keys.append(school_id)
    raw_testing_scores_values.append(school_info)

# Print the first three keys and values
print(raw_testing_scores_keys[0:3])
print(raw_testing_scores_values[0:3])
```

### Explanation:
- `raw_testing_scores.items()`: Returns both the keys and values of the dictionary as pairs.
- `for school_id, school_info in raw_testing_scores.items()`: Simultaneously iterates over keys and values.
- `append()`: Adds each key to `raw_testing_scores_keys` and each value to `raw_testing_scores_values`.
- `print()`: Outputs the first three keys and values for verification.
