# Transforming JSON data

Transforming JSON data
Chances are, when reading data from JSON format into a dictionary, you'll probably have to apply some level of manual transformation to the data before it can be stored in a DataFrame. This is common when working with nested dictionaries, which you'll have the opportunity to explore in this exercise.

The "nested_school_scores.json" file has been read into a dictionary available in the raw_testing_scores variable, which takes the following form:

{
    "01M539": {
        "street_address": "111 Columbia Street",
        "city": "Manhattan",
        "scores": {
              "math": 657,
              "reading": 601,
              "writing": 601
        }
  }, ...
}

Loop through both the keys and values of the raw_testing_scores dictionary.
Extract the "street_address" from each dictionary nested in the raw_testing_scores object.

normalized_testing_scores = []

# Loop through each of the dictionary key-value pairs
for school_id, school_info in raw_testing_scores.____():
	normalized_testing_scores.append([
    	school_id,
    	school_info.____("____"),  # Pull the "street_address"
    	school_info.get("city"),
    	school_info.get("scores").get("math", 0),
    	school_info.get("scores").get("reading", 0),
    	school_info.get("scores").get("writing", 0),
    ])

print(normalized_testing_scores)

Here's how to transform the JSON data by extracting the necessary information from the nested dictionaries:

```python
normalized_testing_scores = []

# Loop through each of the dictionary key-value pairs
for school_id, school_info in raw_testing_scores.items():
    normalized_testing_scores.append([
        school_id,
        school_info.get("street_address"),  # Pull the "street_address"
        school_info.get("city"),
        school_info.get("scores", {}).get("math", 0),
        school_info.get("scores", {}).get("reading", 0),
        school_info.get("scores", {}).get("writing", 0),
    ])

print(normalized_testing_scores)
```

### Explanation:
- `raw_testing_scores.items()`: Iterates through both the keys and values of the `raw_testing_scores` dictionary.
- `school_info.get("street_address")`: Retrieves the "street_address" from each nested dictionary.
- `school_info.get("scores", {}).get("math", 0)`: Safely retrieves the "math" score from the "scores" dictionary, defaulting to 0 if not found. The empty dictionary `{}` as a fallback ensures the `.get()` method does not fail if "scores" is missing.
- `school_info.get("city")`: Retrieves the "city" value directly.
- The result is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a school's ID, street address, city, and scores.
