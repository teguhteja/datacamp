# Grouping data with pandas

Grouping data with pandas
The output of a data pipeline is typically a "modeled" dataset. This dataset provides data consumers easy access to information, without having to perform much manipulation. Grouping data with pandas helps to build modeled datasets,

pandas has been imported as pd, and the raw_testing_scores DataFrame contains data in the following form:

              street_address       city  math_score  reading_score  writing_score
01M539   111 Columbia Street  Manhattan       657.0          601.0          601.0
02M294      350 Grand Street  Manhattan       395.0          411.0          387.0
02M308      350 Grand Street  Manhattan       418.0          428.0          415.0

Use .loc[] to only keep the "city", "math_score", "reading_score", and "writing_score" columns.
Group the DataFrame by the "city" column, and find the mean of each city's math, reading, and writing scores.
Use the transform() function to create a grouped DataFrame.


def transform(raw_data):
	# Use .loc[] to only return the needed columns
	raw_data = raw_data.____[:, ____]
	
    # Group the data by city, return the grouped DataFrame
	grouped_data = raw_data.____(by=["____"], axis=0).____()
	return grouped_data

# Transform the data, print the head of the DataFrame
grouped_testing_scores = ____(raw_testing_scores)
print(grouped_testing_scores.head())

To complete this task, we'll need to use `.loc[]` to select only the relevant columns, group the DataFrame by the `"city"` column, and compute the mean of the scores for each group.

Hereâ€™s the updated function:

```python
def transform(raw_data):
    # Use .loc[] to only return the needed columns
    raw_data = raw_data.loc[:, ["city", "math_score", "reading_score", "writing_score"]]
    
    # Group the data by city, return the grouped DataFrame with the mean
    grouped_data = raw_data.groupby(by=["city"]).mean()
    
    return grouped_data

# Transform the data, print the head of the DataFrame
grouped_testing_scores = transform(raw_testing_scores)
print(grouped_testing_scores.head())
```

### Explanation:
- `raw_data.loc[:, ["city", "math_score", "reading_score", "writing_score"]]` selects the desired columns.
- `raw_data.groupby(by=["city"]).mean()` groups the data by the `"city"` column and calculates the mean for each of the score columns.
- The function returns the grouped data and displays the first few rows.

This will give you a DataFrame where the rows are grouped by city, and the columns contain the mean values for the scores.
