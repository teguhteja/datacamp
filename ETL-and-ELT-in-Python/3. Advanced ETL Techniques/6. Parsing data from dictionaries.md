# Parsing data from dictionaries

Parsing data from dictionaries
When JSON data is loaded into memory, the resulting dictionary can be complicated. Key-value pairs may contain another dictionary, such are called nested dictionaries. These nested dictionaries are frequently encountered when dealing with APIs or other JSON data. In this exercise, you will practice extracting data from nested dictionaries and handling missing values.

The dictionary below is stored in the school variable. Good luck!

{
    "street_address": "111 Columbia Street",
    "city": "Manhattan",
    "scores": {
        "math": 657,
        "reading": 601
    }
}

Parse the value stored at the "street_address" key from the school dictionary.
Parse the value stored at the "scores" key from the school dictionary.
Parse the values stored at the "math", "reading", and "writing" keys from the scores dictionary, and set the default value to 0.

# Parse the street_address from the dictionary
street_address = school.____("street_address")

# Parse the scores dictionary
scores = school.____("____")

# Try to parse the math, reading and writing values from scores
math_score = scores.____("math", ____)
reading_score = scores.____
writing_score = ____

print(f"Street Address: {street_address}")
print(f"Math: {math_score}, Reading: {reading_score}, Writing: {writing_score}")

Here's how to parse data from the `school` dictionary, including handling missing values:

```python
# Example school dictionary
school = {
    "street_address": "111 Columbia Street",
    "city": "Manhattan",
    "scores": {
        "math": 657,
        "reading": 601
    }
}

# Parse the street_address from the dictionary
street_address = school.get("street_address")

# Parse the scores dictionary
scores = school.get("scores", {})

# Try to parse the math, reading, and writing values from scores
math_score = scores.get("math", 0)
reading_score = scores.get("reading", 0)
writing_score = scores.get("writing", 0)

print(f"Street Address: {street_address}")
print(f"Math: {math_score}, Reading: {reading_score}, Writing: {writing_score}")
```

### Explanation:
- `school.get("street_address")`: Safely retrieves the value for "street_address".
- `school.get("scores", {})`: Retrieves the "scores" dictionary or an empty dictionary if "scores" is not present.
- `scores.get("math", 0)`: Retrieves the value for "math", defaulting to 0 if the key is missing.
- `scores.get("reading", 0)`: Retrieves the "reading" score with a default value of 0.
- `scores.get("writing", 0)`: Retrieves the "writing" score, defaulting to 0 if not present.
