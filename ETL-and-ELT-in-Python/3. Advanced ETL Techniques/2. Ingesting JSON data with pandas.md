# Ingesting JSON data with pandas

Ingesting JSON data with pandas
When developing a data pipeline, you may have to work with non-tabular data and data sources, such as APIs or JSON files. In this exercise, we'll practice extracting data from a JSON file using pandas.

pandas has been imported as pd, and the JSON file you'll ingest is stored at the path "testing_scores.json".

Update the extract() function read a JSON file into a pandas DataFrame, orienting by records.
Pass the path testing_scores.json to the extract() function, and store the output to a variable called raw_testing_scores.
Print the head of the raw_testing_scores DataFrame.

def extract(file_path):
  # Read the JSON file into a DataFrame
  return pd.____(____, orient="____")

# Call the extract function with the appropriate path, assign to raw_testing_scores
____

# Output the head of the DataFrame
print(raw_testing_scores.____())

Hereâ€™s how to correctly modify the `extract` function to read a JSON file into a pandas DataFrame, orienting by records:

```python
import pandas as pd

def extract(file_path):
    # Read the JSON file into a DataFrame, orient by records
    return pd.read_json(file_path, orient="records")

# Call the extract function with the appropriate path, assign to raw_testing_scores
raw_testing_scores = extract("testing_scores.json")

# Output the head of the DataFrame
print(raw_testing_scores.head())
```

### Explanation:
- `pd.read_json(file_path, orient="records")`: This reads the JSON file, interpreting each record as a row in the DataFrame.
- `head()`: Displays the first few rows of the DataFrame.
