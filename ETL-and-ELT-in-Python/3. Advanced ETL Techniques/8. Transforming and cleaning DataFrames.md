# Transforming and cleaning DataFrames

Transforming and cleaning DataFrames
Once data has been curated into a cleaned Python data structure, such as a list of lists, it's easy to convert this into a pandas DataFrame. You'll practice doing just this with the data that was curated in the last exercise.

Per usual, pandas has been imported as pd, and the normalized_testing_scores variable stores the list of each schools testing data, as shown below.

[
    ['01M539', '111 Columbia Street', 'Manhattan', 657.0, 601.0, 601.0],
    ...
]

Create a pandas DataFrame from the list of lists stored in the normalized_testing_scores variable.
Set the columns names for the normalized_data DataFrame.

# Create a DataFrame from the normalized_testing_scores list
normalized_data = ____(normalized_testing_scores)

# Set the column names
normalized_data.____ = ["school_id", "street_address", "city", "avg_score_math", "avg_score_reading", "avg_score_writing"]

normalized_data = normalized_data.set_index("school_id")
print(normalized_data.head())

Here's how you can create and transform the DataFrame:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame from the normalized_testing_scores list
normalized_data = pd.DataFrame(normalized_testing_scores)

# Set the column names
normalized_data.columns = ["school_id", "street_address", "city", "avg_score_math", "avg_score_reading", "avg_score_writing"]

# Set the "school_id" column as the index
normalized_data = normalized_data.set_index("school_id")

# Print the head of the DataFrame
print(normalized_data.head())
```

### Explanation:
- `pd.DataFrame(normalized_testing_scores)`: Converts the list of lists into a pandas DataFrame.
- `normalized_data.columns`: Sets the column names for the DataFrame.
- `set_index("school_id")`: Sets the "school_id" column as the index of the DataFrame.
- `head()`: Displays the first few rows of the DataFrame for inspection.
