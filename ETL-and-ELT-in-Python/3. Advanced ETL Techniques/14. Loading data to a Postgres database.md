# Loading data to a Postgres database

Loading data to a Postgres database
After data has been extracted from a source system and transformed to align with analytics or reporting use cases, it's time to load the data to a final storage medium. Storing cleaned data in a SQL database makes it simple for data consumers to access and run queries against. In this example, you'll practice loading cleaned data to a Postgres database.

sqlalchemy has been imported, and pandas is available as pd. The first few rows of the cleaned_testing_scores DataFrame are shown below:

             street_address       city  math_score  ... best_score
01M539  111 Columbia Street  Manhattan       657.0      Math
02M545     350 Grand Street  Manhattan       613.0      Math
01M292     220 Henry Street  Manhattan       410.0      Math

Update the connection string to write to the schools database and create a connection object using sqlalchemy.
Use pandas to write the cleaned_testing_scores DataFrame to the scores table in the schools database.
If the table is already populated with data, make sure to replace the values with the current DataFrame.

# Update the connection string, create the connection object to the schools database
db_engine = sqlalchemy.____("postgresql+psycopg2://repl:password@localhost:5432/____")

# Write the DataFrame to the scores table
cleaned_testing_scores.____(
	name="____",
	con=db_engine,
	index=False,
	if_exists="____"
)

To complete this task, you need to create a connection to the Postgres database using SQLAlchemy, and then use the pandas `to_sql()` method to write the `cleaned_testing_scores` DataFrame to the `scores` table in the `schools` database. If the table already exists, you should replace its existing data.

### Solution:

```python
import sqlalchemy
import pandas as pd

# Update the connection string, create the connection object to the schools database
db_engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine("postgresql+psycopg2://repl:password@localhost:5432/schools")

# Write the DataFrame to the scores table
cleaned_testing_scores.to_sql(
    name="scores",      # The name of the table in the database
    con=db_engine,      # The database connection object
    index=False,        # Do not write the DataFrame index as a column
    if_exists="replace" # Replace the existing table if it exists
)
```

### Explanation:

1. **`sqlalchemy.create_engine()`**: 
   - This creates a connection to the `schools` database hosted on `localhost` at port `5432`, using `psycopg2` as the PostgreSQL adapter.
   - The format for the connection string is: `postgresql+psycopg2://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database_name>`.
   - In this case: `repl` is the username, `password` is the password, and the database is named `schools`.

2. **`cleaned_testing_scores.to_sql()`**: 
   - This method writes the data in the `cleaned_testing_scores` DataFrame to the specified `scores` table.
   - `name="scores"`: Specifies the name of the table to write to.
   - `con=db_engine`: Uses the created connection object to the database.
   - `index=False`: Prevents pandas from writing the DataFrame index as a separate column.
   - `if_exists="replace"`: Ensures that if the `scores` table already exists, it will be replaced with the new data from the `cleaned_testing_scores` DataFrame.

This code ensures that your `cleaned_testing_scores` DataFrame is written to the `scores` table in the Postgres `schools` database. If the table exists, it will be replaced with the new data.
