# Checking inflation

Checking inflation
You've been asked to support the UK Government in analyzing their inflation statistics.

They've supplied you with data for September and August 2023 stored as two float variables, inflation_september and inflation_august respectively.

You'll need to build a workflow that compares these statistics.

Check if inflation_september is less than inflation_august, printing "Inflation decreased" if this is the case.

# Check if September inflation is less than August inflation
____ ____ ____ ____:
	____("____")


To check if the inflation for September is less than that for August and print a message accordingly, you can use an `if` statement in Python. Here's how to do it:

```python
# Assuming these values are provided
inflation_september = 3.1  # Example value for September inflation
inflation_august = 3.5      # Example value for August inflation

# Check if September inflation is less than August inflation
if inflation_september < inflation_august:
    print("Inflation decreased")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Comparison**: The line `if inflation_september < inflation_august:` checks if the value of `inflation_september` is less than that of `inflation_august`.
2. **Print Statement**: If the condition is true, it executes the `print("Inflation decreased")` statement.

### Output:
If `inflation_september` is indeed less than `inflation_august`, the output will be:
```plaintext
Inflation decreased
```

Feel free to replace the example inflation values with the actual data you have, and let me know if you need further assistance!

To include an `else` statement that checks if the inflation for September is greater than that for August and prints a message accordingly, you can extend the previous code. Here’s how to do it:

```python
# Assuming these values are provided
inflation_september = 3.1  # Example value for September inflation
inflation_august = 3.5      # Example value for August inflation

# Check if September inflation is less than August inflation
if inflation_september < inflation_august:
    print("Inflation decreased")
# Else, check if September inflation is more than August inflation
elif inflation_september > inflation_august:
    print("Inflation increased")
```

### Explanation:
1. **First Condition**: The first `if` checks if `inflation_september` is less than `inflation_august`. If true, it prints "Inflation decreased".
2. **Else If Condition**: The `elif` checks if `inflation_september` is greater than `inflation_august`. If this condition is true, it prints "Inflation increased".

### Complete Example:
Here’s the complete code with both conditions:

```python
# Example inflation values
inflation_september = 3.1  # Example value for September inflation
inflation_august = 3.5      # Example value for August inflation

# Check if September inflation is less than August inflation
if inflation_september < inflation_august:
    print("Inflation decreased")
# Else, check if September inflation is more than August inflation
elif inflation_september > inflation_august:
    print("Inflation increased")
# Optional: You can add an else statement for equal inflation
else:
    print("Inflation remained the same")
```

### Output:
Based on the example values:
- If `inflation_september` (3.1) is less than `inflation_august` (3.5), it will print:
  ```plaintext
  Inflation decreased
  ```

You can test with different values, and let me know if you need more help!


To add an `else` statement that prints "Inflation remained stable" when the inflation rates for September and August are equal, you can modify the previous code like this:

```python
# Example inflation values
inflation_september = 3.1  # Example value for September inflation
inflation_august = 3.5      # Example value for August inflation

# Check if September inflation is less than August inflation
if inflation_september < inflation_august:
    print("Inflation decreased")
# Check if September inflation is more than August inflation
elif inflation_september > inflation_august:
    print("Inflation increased")
# Otherwise, if neither condition is true
else:
    print("Inflation remained stable")
```

### Explanation:
1. **If Condition**: Checks if `inflation_september` is less than `inflation_august` and prints "Inflation decreased" if true.
2. **Elif Condition**: Checks if `inflation_september` is greater than `inflation_august` and prints "Inflation increased" if true.
3. **Else Condition**: If neither of the above conditions is true (which means the two values are equal), it prints "Inflation remained stable".

### Complete Example:
Here's the complete code snippet again:

```python
# Example inflation values
inflation_september = 3.1  # Example value for September inflation
inflation_august = 3.5      # Example value for August inflation

# Check if September inflation is less than August inflation
if inflation_september < inflation_august:
    print("Inflation decreased")
# Check if September inflation is more than August inflation
elif inflation_september > inflation_august:
    print("Inflation increased")
# Otherwise, if neither condition is true
else:
    print("Inflation remained stable")
```

### Output:
- If `inflation_september` is less than `inflation_august`, it will print:
  ```plaintext
  Inflation decreased
  ```
- If `inflation_september` is greater than `inflation_august`, it will print:
  ```plaintext
  Inflation increased
  ```
- If both values are equal, it will print:
  ```plaintext
  Inflation remained stable
  ```

You can change the example inflation values to test different scenarios! Let me know if you need further assistance.
