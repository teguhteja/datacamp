# Book genre popularity

Book genre popularity
Previously, you worked with a dictionary containing information about authors and the number of books that they have written.

In this exercise, data about the same authors has been aggregated to create a new dictionary called genre_sales, where the keys are the genre and the values are the average sales for that genre among the 20 most popular authors.

Your job is to find the most and least popular genres among these authors, along with their average sales revenue.

Filter where average_sale is equal to the largest sales revenue (5166000000) in genre_sales.
Print the genre with the largest average sales.
Next, filter where average_sale is equal to the smallest sales revenue (80000000).
Lastly, print the genre with the smallest average sales.

for genre, average_sale in genre_sales.items():
    
    # Filter for the maximum sales value
    if _____ 5166000000:
      
      # Print the genre
      print("Most popular genre: ", _____)
      print("Average sales: ", average_sale)
    
    # Filter for the minimum sales value
    elif _____ 80000000:
      
      # Print the genre
      print("Least popular genre: ", _____)
      print("Average sales: ", average_sale)


To complete the task of finding the most and least popular genres based on their average sales, you can follow the structure given in your prompt while ensuring the conditions in the `if` statements are correctly implemented. Here’s how to fill in the blanks:

### Completed Code

```python
for genre, average_sale in genre_sales.items():
    
    # Filter for the maximum sales value
    if average_sale == 5166000000:
        # Print the genre
        print("Most popular genre: ", genre)
        print("Average sales: ", average_sale)
    
    # Filter for the minimum sales value
    elif average_sale == 80000000:
        # Print the genre
        print("Least popular genre: ", genre)
        print("Average sales: ", average_sale)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Loop through the Dictionary**:
   - `for genre, average_sale in genre_sales.items():` iterates over each genre and its corresponding average sales.

2. **Checking for Maximum Sales**:
   - `if average_sale == 5166000000:` checks if the current `average_sale` equals the maximum sales revenue. If true, it prints the genre and the average sales.

3. **Checking for Minimum Sales**:
   - `elif average_sale == 80000000:` checks if the `average_sale` is equal to the minimum sales revenue. If true, it prints the genre and the average sales.

### Final Output:
This code will output the most popular genre and the least popular genre based on the given average sales figures.
