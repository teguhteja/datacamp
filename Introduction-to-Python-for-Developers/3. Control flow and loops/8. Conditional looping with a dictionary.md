# Conditional looping with a dictionary

Conditional looping with a dictionary
Your friend at LLM Camp has provided you with a dictionary called courses. It contains the names of courses as keys and their associated topic as a value. There are three topics: "AI", "Programming", and "Data Engineering".

courses = {"LLM Concepts": "AI", 
           "Introduction to Data Pipelines": "Data Engineering", 
           "AI Ethics": "AI",
           "Introduction to dbt": "Data Engineering", 
           "Writing Efficient Python Code": "Programming",
           "Introduction to Docker": "Programming"}
This is a great chance to practice looping through dictionaries!

Create a for loop to iterate over key, value in courses.items().
Check if the value is "AI", and print the key if so.
Else, check if the value is "Programming", printing the key if so.
Otherwise, print the key to confirm it is a "Data Engineering" course.

# Loop through the dictionary's keys and values
____ key, value ____ courses.items():
  
  # Check if the value is "AI"
  ____ ____ ____ "____":
    print(____, "is an AI course")
  
  # Check if the value is "Programming"
  ____ ____ ____ "____":
    print(____, "is a Programming course")
  
  # Otherwise, print that it is a "Data Engineering" course
  ____:
    print(____, "is a Data Engineering course")


Here's how you can implement the conditional looping through the `courses` dictionary to classify the courses based on their topics:

```python
courses = {
    "LLM Concepts": "AI",
    "Introduction to Data Pipelines": "Data Engineering",
    "AI Ethics": "AI",
    "Introduction to dbt": "Data Engineering",
    "Writing Efficient Python Code": "Programming",
    "Introduction to Docker": "Programming"
}

# Loop through the dictionary's keys and values
for key, value in courses.items():
    # Check if the value is "AI"
    if value == "AI":
        print(key, "is an AI course")
    
    # Check if the value is "Programming"
    elif value == "Programming":
        print(key, "is a Programming course")
    
    # Otherwise, print that it is a "Data Engineering" course
    else:
        print(key, "is a Data Engineering course")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Dictionary Definition**:
   - The `courses` dictionary is defined with course names as keys and their associated topics as values.

2. **For Loop**:
   - The loop `for key, value in courses.items():` iterates through each key-value pair in the `courses` dictionary.

3. **Conditional Checks**:
   - **First Condition**: `if value == "AI":` checks if the course topic is "AI". If true, it prints that the course is an AI course.
   - **Second Condition**: `elif value == "Programming":` checks if the course topic is "Programming". If true, it prints that the course is a Programming course.
   - **Else Statement**: If neither condition is met, it concludes that the course topic is "Data Engineering" and prints that information.

### Output:
When you run this code, it will print statements indicating the category of each course based on its topic. This is a great way to practice using loops and conditionals in Python! Let me know if you need any further help!
