# On the rental market

On the rental market
You are looking to move and have defined variables containing your requirements/limits for number of bedrooms, minimum square feet (area), and maximum rent:

min_num_beds = 2
min_sq_foot = 750
max_rent = 1900
You've seen a property you are interested in and have stored its information in the variables num_beds, sq_foot, and rent. You will build a custom workflow to check if this potential property suits your needs.

Instructions

Check if num_beds is less than min_num_beds, printing "Insufficient bedrooms" if this is the case.
Else, check if sq_foot is less than or equal to min_sq_foot, printing "Too small" if this is the case.
Else, check if rent is more than max_rent, printing "Too expensive" if this is the case.
Otherwise, print "This looks promising!".

# Check the number of beds
_____ _____ _____ _____:
  ____("____")

# Check square feet


  
# Check the rent


  
#Â If all conditions met


To create a workflow that checks the rental property against your requirements, you can structure your code using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements. Here's how you can implement it:

```python
# Define your requirements
min_num_beds = 2
min_sq_foot = 750
max_rent = 1900

# Example property information
num_beds = 2      # Number of bedrooms in the property
sq_foot = 800     # Square footage of the property
rent = 1800       # Rent for the property

# Check the number of beds
if num_beds < min_num_beds:
    print("Insufficient bedrooms")
# Check square feet
elif sq_foot <= min_sq_foot:
    print("Too small")
# Check the rent
elif rent > max_rent:
    print("Too expensive")
# If all conditions are met
else:
    print("This looks promising!")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Check Number of Beds**: The first `if` statement checks if the number of bedrooms (`num_beds`) is less than the minimum required (`min_num_beds`). If true, it prints "Insufficient bedrooms."
  
2. **Check Square Feet**: The `elif` statement checks if the square footage (`sq_foot`) is less than or equal to the minimum required square feet (`min_sq_foot`). If true, it prints "Too small."
  
3. **Check Rent**: The next `elif` checks if the rent (`rent`) exceeds the maximum allowed (`max_rent`). If true, it prints "Too expensive."
  
4. **If All Conditions Met**: If none of the conditions are true, the `else` statement prints "This looks promising!" indicating the property meets all your requirements.

### Output:
- If `num_beds` is less than `min_num_beds`, it will print:
  ```plaintext
  Insufficient bedrooms
  ```
- If `sq_foot` is less than or equal to `min_sq_foot`, it will print:
  ```plaintext
  Too small
  ```
- If `rent` is greater than `max_rent`, it will print:
  ```plaintext
  Too expensive
  ```
- If the property meets all the requirements, it will print:
  ```plaintext
  This looks promising!
  ```

Feel free to change the values of `num_beds`, `sq_foot`, and `rent` to test different scenarios. Let me know if you need further help!
