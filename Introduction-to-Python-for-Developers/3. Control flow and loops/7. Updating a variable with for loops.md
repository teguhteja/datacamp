# Updating a variable with for loops

Updating a variable with for loops
You're planning to hold a party so you can show off your playlist to friends and family. You've hired a venue that has a maximum capacity of 30 people, and you'd like to keep track of tickets sold.

This is a perfect opportunity to use a for loop - it will increment the value of a variable each time a ticket is sold and then print a statement once the event is sold out.

Instructions

Create a variable called tickets_sold with a value of 0.
Create a variable called max_capacity with a value of 30.
Loop through a range starting at 1 and finishing at max_capacity plus one.
Inside the for loop, add 1 to the value of tickets_sold.

# Create the tickets_sold variable
____

# Create the max_capacity variable
____

# Loop through a range up to and including max_capacity's value
____ ____ ____ ____(____, ____):
  
  # Add one to tickets_sold in each iteration
  ____ ____ ____
  
print("Sold out:", tickets_sold, "tickets sold!")


To implement the ticket sales tracking using a for loop, follow these instructions. Here’s how you can structure your code:

```python
# Create the tickets_sold variable
tickets_sold = 0

# Create the max_capacity variable
max_capacity = 30

# Loop through a range up to and including max_capacity's value
for ticket in range(1, max_capacity + 1):
    # Add one to tickets_sold in each iteration
    tickets_sold += 1

print("Sold out:", tickets_sold, "tickets sold!")
```

### Explanation:
- **Variable Initialization**:
  - `tickets_sold` is initialized to 0 to track the number of tickets sold.
  - `max_capacity` is set to 30, which represents the maximum number of attendees allowed.
  
- **For Loop**:
  - `for ticket in range(1, max_capacity + 1):` iterates from 1 to 30 (inclusive). The `range` function generates numbers starting from 1 up to `max_capacity + 1`, which effectively means it includes the number 30.
  
- **Updating Tickets Sold**:
  - `tickets_sold += 1` increments the `tickets_sold` variable by 1 for each iteration of the loop, simulating the sale of one ticket per iteration.

- **Final Print Statement**:
  - Once the loop completes, the message `Sold out: 30 tickets sold!` is printed, indicating that the venue is full.
