# Looping through a list

Looping through a list
Time to test your for-loop skills! In the script.py a list called user_ids has been stored, containing, you guessed it - user IDs!

Your task is to loop through the list and print each ID individually.

Create a for loop to iterate over each user_id in user_ids.
Within the for loop, print the user_id.

user_ids = ["T42YG4KTK", "VTQ39IDQ0", "CRL11YUWX", 
            "K6Y5URXLR", "V4XCBER7V", "IOGQWC61K"]

# Loop through user_ids
____ ____ ____ ____:
  # Print the user_id
  ____


To iterate through the `user_ids` list and print each ID, you can use a `for` loop. Here's how you can implement it:

```python
user_ids = ["T42YG4KTK", "VTQ39IDQ0", "CRL11YUWX", 
            "K6Y5URXLR", "V4XCBER7V", "IOGQWC61K"]

# Loop through user_ids
for user_id in user_ids:
    # Print the user_id
    print(user_id)
```

### Explanation:
- **For Loop**: The line `for user_id in user_ids:` creates a loop that goes through each element in the `user_ids` list. Each element is temporarily stored in the variable `user_id` during each iteration.
- **Print Statement**: The `print(user_id)` line inside the loop prints the current user ID.

### Output:
When you run this code, it will print each user ID from the list, one per line:
```
T42YG4KTK
VTQ39IDQ0
CRL11YUWX
K6Y5URXLR
V4XCBER7V
IOGQWC61K
```

Feel free to run the code in your environment, and let me know if you have any questions!
