# Working with keywords

To loop through the `genre_sales` dictionary and check for the genres "Horror" or "Mystery," you can fill in the blanks in your code as follows:

### Completed Code

```python
# Loop through the dictionary
for genre, sale in genre_sales.items():
  
    # Check if genre is Horror or Mystery
    if genre == "Horror" or genre == "Mystery":
        print(genre, sale)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Loop through the Dictionary**:
   - `for genre, sale in genre_sales.items():` iterates over each key-value pair in the `genre_sales` dictionary, where `genre` is the key and `sale` is the value.

2. **Check for Conditions**:
   - The condition `if genre == "Horror" or genre == "Mystery":` checks if the current genre is either "Horror" or "Mystery". If this condition is true, it executes the print statement.

3. **Print the Genre and Sale**:
   - `print(genre, sale)` outputs the genre and its corresponding average sales.

### Final Output:
This code will print the average sales for both the "Horror" and "Mystery" genres if they exist in the `genre_sales` dictionary.

To check if the genre is "Thriller" and the average sales are greater than or equal to 3,000,000, you can modify your loop as follows:

### Updated Code

```python
# Loop through the dictionary
for genre, sale in genre_sales.items():
  
    # Check if genre is Thriller and average sales are >= 3000000
    if genre == "Thriller" and sale >= 3000000:
        print(genre, sale)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Loop through the Dictionary**:
   - `for genre, sale in genre_sales.items():` iterates over each key-value pair in the `genre_sales` dictionary.

2. **Check for Conditions**:
   - The condition `if genre == "Thriller" and sale >= 3000000:` checks if the current genre is "Thriller" **and** if the average sales (`sale`) are greater than or equal to 3,000,000.

3. **Print the Genre and Sale**:
   - If both conditions are met, `print(genre, sale)` will output the genre and its corresponding average sales.

### Final Output:
This code will print the average sales for the "Thriller" genre if it meets the specified condition.
