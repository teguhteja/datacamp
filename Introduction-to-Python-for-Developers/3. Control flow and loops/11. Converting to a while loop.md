# Converting to a while loop

Converting to a while loop
You can often achieve the same tasks using either a for or while loop.

To demonstrate this, you're going to take the for loop you built earlier in the course and modify it to use a while loop that achieves the same results!

# Create the tickets_sold variable
tickets_sold = 0

# Create the max_capacity variable
max_capacity = 10

#&nbsp;Loop through a range up to and including max_capacity's value
for tickets in range(1, max_capacity + 1):

  # Add one to tickets_sold in each iteration
  tickets_sold += 1

print("Sold out:", tickets_sold, "tickets sold!")

Create a while loop to run while tickets_sold is less than max_capacity.
Inside the loop, increment tickets_sold by 1, representing an increase for each ticket sold.
Outside of the loop, print tickets_sold.

tickets_sold = 0
max_capacity = 10

#Â Create a while loop
____ ____ ____ ____:
  
  # Add one to tickets_sold in each iteration
  tickets_sold += ____

# Print the number of tickets sold
print("Sold out:", ____, "tickets sold!")

You can convert the for loop to a while loop to achieve the same result of incrementing the `tickets_sold` variable. Here's how you can do it:

```python
tickets_sold = 0
max_capacity = 10

# Create a while loop
while tickets_sold < max_capacity:
    # Add one to tickets_sold in each iteration
    tickets_sold += 1

# Print the number of tickets sold
print("Sold out:", tickets_sold, "tickets sold!")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `tickets_sold` is initialized to 0, and `max_capacity` is set to 10.

2. **While Loop**:
   - The loop `while tickets_sold < max_capacity:` continues to run as long as `tickets_sold` is less than `max_capacity`.

3. **Incrementing Tickets Sold**:
   - Inside the loop, `tickets_sold += 1` increments the `tickets_sold` variable by 1 each time the loop runs, simulating the sale of a ticket.

4. **Final Output**:
   - After the loop finishes (when `tickets_sold` equals `max_capacity`), the program prints the total number of tickets sold.

### Output:
When you run this code, it will print:
```
Sold out: 10 tickets sold!
```

This demonstrates how you can replace a for loop with a while loop to achieve the same outcome. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
