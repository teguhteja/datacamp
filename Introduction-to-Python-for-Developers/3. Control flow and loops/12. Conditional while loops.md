# Conditional while loops

Conditional while loops
You've offered to help build a program that LLM Camp can use to promote an upcoming new course launching on the 26th of the month.

Today's date is the 22nd, and they have a pre-release version available from the 24th for all users who purchase a subscription on or before the 24th!

You'll need to build a custom workflow that provides tailored messages depending on the date.

Create a while loop based on current_date being less than or equal to release_date.
Increment current_date by one for each day that passes.
Check if current_date is less than or equal to 24 and, if so, print "Purchase before the 25th for early access"
Otherwise, check if current_date is equal to 25, printing "Coming soon!"

release_date = 26
current_date = 22

# Create a conditional loop while current_date is less than or equal to the release_date
____:
  
  # Increment current_date by one
  ____ += ____
  
  # Promote purchases
  ____:
    print("____")
  
  # Check if the date is equal to the 25th
  ____:
    print("____")
  else:
    print("Available now!")


You can create a while loop to check the current date against the release date and print the appropriate promotional messages. Here's how you can do that:

```python
release_date = 26
current_date = 22

# Create a conditional loop while current_date is less than or equal to the release_date
while current_date <= release_date:
  
    # Increment current_date by one
    current_date += 1
  
    # Promote purchases
    if current_date <= 24:
        print("Purchase before the 25th for early access")
  
    # Check if the date is equal to the 25th
    elif current_date == 25:
        print("Coming soon!")
    else:
        print("Available now!")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `release_date` is set to 26 and `current_date` is initialized to 22.

2. **While Loop**:
   - The loop continues to run as long as `current_date` is less than or equal to `release_date`.

3. **Incrementing Current Date**:
   - Inside the loop, `current_date` is incremented by 1 each iteration.

4. **Conditional Checks**:
   - If `current_date` is less than or equal to 24, it prints: 
     ```
     Purchase before the 25th for early access
     ```
   - If `current_date` equals 25, it prints:
     ```
     Coming soon!
     ```
   - After the loop completes (when `current_date` is 26), it prints:
     ```
     Available now!
     ```

### Output:
When you run this code, the output will be:
```
Purchase before the 25th for early access
Purchase before the 25th for early access
Coming soon!
Available now!
```

This demonstrates how to use a while loop with conditional statements to provide tailored messages based on the current date. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
