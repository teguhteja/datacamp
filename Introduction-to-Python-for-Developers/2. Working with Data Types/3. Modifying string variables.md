# Modifying string variables

Modifying string variables
You did so well working with LLM Camp's reviews that they've asked for your help again.

They have a variable called most_popular_course, which contains the name of their highest-ranked course. It has been provided in script.py so you can see its contents. However, there are issues with it:

There's a typo. It should be "Introduction" rather than "Intro".
They want to remove spaces and use underscores to make it easier to analyze.
For consistency, they want all characters to be lowercase.
They'd like your support in making these changes!

Here's how you can update the variable to change "Intro" to "Introduction":

```python
most_popular_course = "Intro to Embeddings with the OpenAI API"

# Update the first word
most_popular_course = most_popular_course.replace("Intro", "Introduction")

print(most_popular_course)
``` 

This code will replace "Intro" with "Introduction" in the `most_popular_course` string.

Here's how you can complete the task by updating the string to remove spaces and change it to lowercase:

```python
# Original variable
most_popular_course = "Intro to Embeddings with the OpenAI API"

# Update the first word
most_popular_course = most_popular_course.replace("Intro", "Introduction")

# Swap spaces for underscores and convert to lowercase
most_popular_course = most_popular_course.replace(" ", "_").lower()

print(most_popular_course)
```

This will result in the string: `"introduction_to_embeddings_with_the_openai_api"`.


To complete the task by converting the string to lowercase, you can fill in the missing part like this:

```python
# Original variable
most_popular_course = "Intro to Embeddings with the OpenAI API"

# Update the first word
most_popular_course = most_popular_course.replace("Intro", "Introduction")

# Swap spaces for underscores
most_popular_course = most_popular_course.replace(" ", "_")

# Change to lowercase
most_popular_course = most_popular_course.lower()

print(most_popular_course)
```

This will output the updated string: `"introduction_to_embeddings_with_the_openai_api"`.
