# DJ Sets

DJ Sets
To practice working with data structures, you decide to split up the music artists in your playlist by genre, allowing you to create sets for each genre.

In this exercise, you'll create a set to hold indie artists as well as convert a list of hip-hop artists into a set.

Instructions 1/3

Create a set called indie_set containing "Kings of Leon", "Arctic Monkeys", and "Stereophonics".

To create a set called `indie_set` containing "Kings of Leon", "Arctic Monkeys", and "Stereophonics", you can use curly brackets `{}`. Here’s how to do it:

```python
# Create a set called indie_set
indie_set = {"Kings of Leon", "Arctic Monkeys", "Stereophonics"}

# Print the set
print(indie_set)
```

### Explanation:
- **Creating a Set**: The line `indie_set = {"Kings of Leon", "Arctic Monkeys", "Stereophonics"}` creates a set with the specified values.
- **Printing the Set**: The `print(indie_set)` statement outputs the contents of the set.

### Output:
When you run the code, the output will be something like:
```plaintext
{'Arctic Monkeys', 'Stereophonics', 'Kings of Leon'}
```

(Note: The order of elements in a set may vary since sets are unordered collections.)

To convert the `hip_hop` list into a set and save it as a new variable called `hip_hop_set`, you can use the `set()` function. Here’s how to do it:

```python
hip_hop = ["Drake", "JAY-Z", "50 Cent", "Drake"]

# Convert the hip_hop list into a set
hip_hop_set = set(hip_hop)

# Print the new set
print(hip_hop_set)
```

### Explanation:
- **List Definition**: The `hip_hop` list is defined with some artist names, including a duplicate ("Drake").
- **Set Conversion**: The line `hip_hop_set = set(hip_hop)` converts the list into a set, which automatically removes duplicates.
- **Printing the Set**: The `print(hip_hop_set)` statement outputs the contents of the newly created set.

### Output:
When you run the code, the output will be similar to:
```plaintext
{'JAY-Z', '50 Cent', 'Drake'}
```

(Note: The order of elements in a set may vary since sets are unordered collections.)

To print both the `indie_set` and `hip_hop_set` set variables, you can simply use the `print()` function for each set. Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Create the hip_hop_set
hip_hop = ["Drake", "JAY-Z", "50 Cent", "Drake"]
hip_hop_set = set(hip_hop)

# Create the indie_set
indie_set = {"Kings of Leon", "Arctic Monkeys", "Stereophonics"}

# Print both sets
print("Hip Hop Set:", hip_hop_set)
print("Indie Set:", indie_set)
```

### Explanation:
- **Printing**: The `print()` statements output the contents of each set. The first line prints the `hip_hop_set` with a label, and the second prints the `indie_set`.

### Output:
When you run the code, the output will look something like this:
```plaintext
Hip Hop Set: {'JAY-Z', '50 Cent', 'Drake'}
Indie Set: {'Arctic Monkeys', 'Stereophonics', 'Kings of Leon'}
```

(Note: The order of elements may vary since sets are unordered collections.)
