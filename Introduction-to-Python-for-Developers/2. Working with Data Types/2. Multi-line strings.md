# Multi-line strings

Multi-line strings
You have a friend who works at an e-learning company called LLM Camp, where they teach people how to work with large language models (LLMS).

They want to use Python to store their user reviews and you've volunteered to help set this up! They've provided two of their most recent reviews:

# review_one
I really enjoy the courses,
and they are easy to fit into my busy schedule. 
I wish I had started using your platform sooner.
I'll be recommending you to my friends!!
# review_two
One year ago, I was unsure of how to make progress in my career. 
Now, I work as a Prompt Engineer, and I can't thank you enough! 
Keep up the great work.
Instructions
100 XP
Store the first review as a multi-line string variable called review_one.
Store the second review as a multi-line string variable called review_two.
Print review_one then print review_two.

# Create review_one
____

# Create review_two
____

# Print the two reviews individually
____
____

Here's how you can store and print the multi-line reviews:

```python
# Create review_one
review_one = """
I really enjoy the courses,
and they are easy to fit into my busy schedule. 
I wish I had started using your platform sooner.
I'll be recommending you to my friends!!
"""

# Create review_two
review_two = """
One year ago, I was unsure of how to make progress in my career. 
Now, I work as a Prompt Engineer, and I can't thank you enough! 
Keep up the great work.
"""

# Print the two reviews individually
print(review_one)
print(review_two)
```

This will store both reviews as multi-line strings and print them individually.
