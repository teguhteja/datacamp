# Subsetting lists

Subsetting lists
You've expanded your playlist. It still contains the song order and song names, but now you've also added the artist name for each song, as well as some additional songs!

It repeats the same order throughout the list - 1) song number, 2) song name, 3) artist name, repeat.

The new playlist has been printed in the IPython Shell for your reference.

This is a great opportunity for you to practice extracting specific information from your list.

Find the name of the second song, which is the fifth element, in the playlist, and print the value.

# Find the second song
print(____)


To print every song name in the playlist starting from the second element and getting every third value, you can use Python's list slicing syntax. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```python
# Assuming the playlist is structured like this:
playlist = [
    1, "Blinding Lights", "The Weeknd",
    2, "One Dance", "Drake",
    3, "Uptown Funk", "Mark Ronson",
    4, "Shape of You", "Ed Sheeran",
    5, "Dance Monkey", "Tones and I"
]

# Print all songs starting from the second element and every third value
print(playlist[1::3])  # Starts from index 1 and gets every third element
```

In this example:
- `playlist[1::3]` starts at index 1 (the second element, "Blinding Lights") and selects every third element thereafter. This will result in a list of song names:

```plaintext
['Blinding Lights', 'One Dance', 'Shape of You']
```

You can adjust the `playlist` variable as needed for your specific list.
