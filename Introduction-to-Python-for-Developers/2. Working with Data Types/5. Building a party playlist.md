Create a list variable called playlist, containing the following numeric and string values (in order):
1, "Blinding Lights", 2, "One Dance", 3, "Uptown Funk".
Print the list.

# Create the playlist variable
____ = ____

# Print the list
____

Here’s how you can create the playlist variable and print it:

```python
# Create the playlist variable
playlist = [1, "Blinding Lights", 2, "One Dance", 3, "Uptown Funk"]

# Print the list
print(playlist)
```

This will create a list called `playlist` containing the specified songs and their order, then print the list.
