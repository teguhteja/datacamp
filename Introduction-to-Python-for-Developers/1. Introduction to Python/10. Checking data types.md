# Checking data types

Checking data types
Python makes our life easier by inferring the type of data we are working with, avoiding the need for us to explicitly declare the data type!

Let's practice checking the data type of different values and variables. Two variables, current_quarter and revenue_on_target have been created and their values printed in the IPython Shell. These variables are available to use in script.py.
