# How to run Python code

1. How to run Python code
00:00 - 00:00
We've talked about why we should use Python, now let's discuss the DataCamp user interface for running code along with learning some Python syntax!

2. The DataCamp interface
00:00 - 00:00
In this course, we will run Python in interactive exercises using this interface. It contains several components. Let's break this down.

3. IPython Shell
00:00 - 00:00
The IPython Shell, highlighted, is a place where we can type Python code and see the results each time we press "Enter" or "Return" to move to a new line.

4. Python Script
00:00 - 00:00
Python files are saved with the dot-py extension, so this highlighted section is a Python file called "script-dot-py". This is where we will complete exercises by filling in missing parts of the file and then clicking the "Submit Answer" button. If we want to check our code before submitting it, we can first click the "Run Code" button, which executes the contents of the script.

5. Code comments
00:00 - 00:00
Let's take a look at some of Python's core syntax. Here, we see a sentence starting with a hash sign. This symbol is used for code comments, meaning the code won't produce a result but is here to help explain what we are doing. Code is typically read more often than it is written, and we often share our code with others, so comments help ensure our code is understandable for anyone using it.

6. Performing calculations
00:00 - 00:00
We've seen how to write code comments, but what about code that produces a result? Let's start by using Python as a calculator. We can provide numbers and use symbols to instruct Python on what we want to calculate. Here, we add four and five. If we've entered this in the IPython shell, like here, we will see what is called an output, which is the result of our code, after pressing return. In this case, Python gives an output of 9.

7. Performing calculations
00:00 - 00:00
While the IPython Shell returns an output automatically, if we want to see the output from script-dot-py, we need to use the print function. To do this, we write print, open parentheses, place the code we want to see the output of inside, and then close the parentheses.

8. More calculations
00:00 - 00:00
If we want to print more than one output, then we call the print function additional times. Here, we use a hyphen to subtract two from five inside the second print function, then use an asterisk to multiply five by three, and lastly, a forward slash to divide ten by two. Clicking submit answer returns the results of those four calculations in the IPython Shell.

9. Calculations cheat sheet
00:00 - 00:00
This table can be used as a reference for which symbols perform what calculations in Python. Let's look at a couple more. First is using two asterisks, which are used for exponentiation, or raising a number to the power of another number. In the example, we raise three to the power of two, which is another way of saying three-squared. The result is nine. We also have modulo, represented by the percentage sign, which calculates the remainder after dividing one number by another. For example, 7 divided by 4 results in 1 with a remainder of 3, because 4 goes into 7 once with 3 left over. This operation is particularly useful to find what remains after a division.

10. Numbers in programming
00:00 - 00:00
We might be wondering why we need to use Python as a calculator. Well, if we are building web apps, we will often need to perform calculations, such as verifying a user's age or finding the average value, like average customer spending per transaction in the last six months. Python makes these tasks simple compared to other languages, which would require much more code to perform!

11. Let's practice!

Now it's your turn to run some Python code!
