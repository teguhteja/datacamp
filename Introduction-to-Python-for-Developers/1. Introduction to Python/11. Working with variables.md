# Working with variables

Working with variables
Variables allow you to store information to refer back to later, such as customer information and timestamps of events. You can also modify the values that are assigned to these variables if circumstances change!

Create a string variable called name, setting it equal to John Smith.
Create an integer variable called age with a value of 47.
Create a string variable called address with a value of The Shard, London, SE1 9SG.
Print the three variables.

# Create a string variable called name
____ = ____

# Create an integer variable called age
____

# Create a string variable called address

# Print their information
____(____, ____,  ____)

It seems like I can’t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later. However, here's how you can write the code to create and print the variables:

```python
# Create a string variable called name
name = "John Smith"

# Create an integer variable called age
age = 47

# Create a string variable called address
address = "The Shard, London, SE1 9SG"

# Print their information
print(name, age, address)
```

This will output the values for the variables when you run it in Python.
