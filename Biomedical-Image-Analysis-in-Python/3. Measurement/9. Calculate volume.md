# Calculate volume

Calculate volume
Quantifying tissue morphology, or shape is one primary objective of biomedical imaging. The size, shape, and uniformity of a tissue can reveal essential health insights.

For this exercise, measure the volume of the left ventricle in one 3D image (vol).

First, count the number of voxels in the left ventricle (label value of 1). Then, multiply it by the size of each voxel in mm
. (Check vol.meta for the sampling rate.)

To calculate the volume of the left ventricle by following the specific instructions, you can use the `ndi.sum` function along with the unit volume calculated from the voxel sampling rates. Here’s how you can implement this in Python:

1. **Calculate the number of pixels in the left ventricle:** Use `ndi.sum(1, labels, index=1)` to sum the pixels labeled as 1 (left ventricle).
2. **Calculate the unit volume for each pixel:** Multiply the sampling rates from `vol.meta['sampling']`.
3. **Calculate the total volume:** Multiply the number of pixels by the unit volume.

Here’s the complete code for this calculation:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import ndimage as ndi

# Assuming 'labels' is your labeled array and 'vol' contains your volume data

# 1. Calculate the number of pixels in the left ventricle
num_pixels_left_ventricle = ndi.sum(1, labels, index=1)

# 2. Get the sampling rates from vol.meta
sampling_rates = vol.meta['sampling']  # This should be a list or array-like structure
unit_volume = np.prod(sampling_rates)  # Calculate the unit volume by multiplying the sampling rates

# 3. Calculate the total volume of the left ventricle
volume_left_ventricle = num_pixels_left_ventricle * unit_volume

print(f"Number of pixels in the left ventricle: {num_pixels_left_ventricle}")
print(f"Unit volume for each pixel: {unit_volume:.2f} mm³")
print(f"Total volume of the left ventricle: {volume_left_ventricle:.2f} mm³")
```

### Breakdown:
- **Counting Pixels:** `num_pixels_left_ventricle = ndi.sum(1, labels, index=1)` counts how many voxels are labeled as 1.
- **Unit Volume Calculation:** `np.prod(sampling_rates)` multiplies the sampling rates together to get the volume for each pixel.
- **Total Volume Calculation:** Finally, multiplying the number of pixels by their unit volume gives the total volume of the left ventricle.

### Conclusion:
Running this code will give you the number of pixels in the left ventricle, the unit volume for each pixel, and the total volume of the left ventricle in mm³. You can then compare this calculated volume with the potential answers provided earlier.

Number of pixels in the left ventricle: 6459
Unit volume for each pixel: 18.69 mm³
Total volume of the left ventricle: 120731.82 mm³
