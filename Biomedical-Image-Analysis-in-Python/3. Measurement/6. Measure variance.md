# Measure variance

Measure variance
SciPy measurement functions allow you to tailor measurements to specific sets of pixels:

Specifying labels restricts the mask to non-zero pixels.
Specifying index value(s) returns a measure for each label value.
For this exercise, calculate the intensity variance of vol with respect to different pixel sets. We have provided the 3D segmented image as labels: label 1 is the left ventricle and label 2 is a circular sample of tissue.

Labeled Volume

After printing the variances, select the true statement from the answers below.


Using vol and labels arrays, measure the variance of pixel intensities in the specified sets of pixels. Print them to the screen.

# Variance for all pixels
var_all = ndi.variance(vol, labels=None, index=None)
print('All pixels:', var_all)

# Variance for labeled pixels
var_labels = ndi.variance(____, _____, ____)
print('Labeled pixels:', ____)

# Variance for each object
var_objects = ____
print('Left ventricle:', var_objects[0])
print('Other tissue:', ____)

# Variance for all pixels
var_all = ndi.variance(vol, labels=None, index=None)
print('All pixels:', var_all)

# Variance for labeled pixels
var_labels = ndi.variance(vol, labels, index=None)
print('Labeled pixels:', var_labels)

# Variance for each object
var_objects = ndi.variance(vol, labels, index=[1,2])
print('Left ventricle:', var_objects[0])
print('Other tissue:', var_objects[1])

Certainly! Let's break down the provided code snippet that calculates the variance of pixel intensities in a volumetric image. This code uses the `scipy.ndimage` library, which offers powerful tools for image processing, especially for multidimensional arrays.

### Code Explanation

```python
# Variance for all pixels
var_all = ndi.variance(vol, labels=None, index=None)
print('All pixels:', var_all)
```
1. **Variance for All Pixels**:
   - **Function**: `ndi.variance(vol, labels=None, index=None)`
     - **`vol`**: This is the input data, which is typically a 3D NumPy array representing the volume of the image (e.g., an MRI scan).
     - **`labels=None`**: By setting `labels` to `None`, the function computes the variance across the entire volume without considering any specific regions or labels.
     - **`index=None`**: This parameter is also set to `None`, meaning that it will consider all pixels in the volume for the calculation.
   - **Purpose**: This line calculates the overall variance of pixel intensities in the entire volume, providing a measure of how much the pixel values vary throughout the whole dataset.
   - **Output**: The result is stored in `var_all` and printed, showing the variance across all pixels.

```python
# Variance for labeled pixels
var_labels = ndi.variance(vol, labels, index=None)
print('Labeled pixels:', var_labels)
```
2. **Variance for Labeled Pixels**:
   - **Function**: `ndi.variance(vol, labels, index=None)`
     - **`vol`**: Same as before, this is the volume data.
     - **`labels`**: This is a labeled array, typically created from a segmentation step where each distinct object (e.g., the left ventricle, other tissues) has been assigned a unique integer label.
     - **`index=None`**: Setting this to `None` indicates that the function will compute the variance for all labeled regions collectively, rather than individually.
   - **Purpose**: This line calculates the variance for all pixels that belong to labeled regions. It provides a measure of the variability of pixel intensities in the regions of interest defined by the `labels` array.
   - **Output**: The result is stored in `var_labels` and printed.

```python
# Variance for each object
var_objects = ndi.variance(vol, labels, index=[1,2])
print('Left ventricle:', var_objects[0])
print('Other tissue:', var_objects[1])
```
3. **Variance for Each Object**:
   - **Function**: `ndi.variance(vol, labels, index=[1,2])`
     - **`vol`**: The same volume data.
     - **`labels`**: The labeled array indicating which pixels belong to which objects.
     - **`index=[1,2]`**: This specifies that the function should compute the variance for the labeled objects corresponding to the indices `1` and `2`. These typically correspond to specific objects, like the left ventricle and another tissue type, respectively.
   - **Purpose**: This line computes the variance of pixel intensities for specific labeled objects, allowing you to quantify how pixel values differ within these individual regions.
   - **Output**: The variances for the specified labels are stored in `var_objects`. The variances for the left ventricle and other tissue are printed using indexing.

### Summary
- This code provides a comprehensive approach to measuring the variance of pixel intensities in a volumetric image:
  - It first calculates the overall variance for all pixels.
  - Then, it measures the variance specifically for labeled pixels.
  - Finally, it extracts and prints the variances for individual labeled objects, which is useful for understanding the characteristics of different tissues or regions within the image.

By analyzing these variances, researchers and clinicians can gain insights into the texture and composition of the tissues in medical imaging datasets.

Based on the provided code and context, here’s an analysis of the variances calculated and the possible interpretations of the results regarding the pixel intensities for different regions:

### Possible Answers Explanation

1. **"Left ventricle" variance is less than "Other tissue" because it uses a smaller set of pixels.**
   - **Explanation**: 
     - The left ventricle may be composed of fewer pixels compared to other tissue types, leading to a smaller range of intensity values. This can result in lower variance because variance measures how much the values differ from the mean; if there is less diversity in pixel intensities (fewer pixels and lower intensity variation), the variance will be lower.
     - The "Other tissue" region might include a wider variety of pixel values, contributing to a higher variance.

2. **"All pixels" has the lowest variance because it has many pixels with 0 values.** (O)
   - **Explanation**: 
     - If the volume (`vol`) contains many pixels with zero values (background or non-relevant areas), the overall variance will be lower. The presence of a large number of zeros can significantly reduce the variance because many pixel values contribute little to no difference from the mean.
     - Thus, the overall variance reflects not just the variability of the labeled regions but also the large presence of low-intensity or zero-value pixels in the entire image.

3. **"Labeled pixels" have high variance because they have the highest mean intensity.**
   - **Explanation**: 
     - The labeled pixels are those that belong to specific regions of interest (e.g., left ventricle and other tissues). If these labeled regions consist of higher intensity values (for example, due to more active or denser tissues), this can lead to a higher mean intensity.
     - Higher mean intensity often correlates with higher variance because there is likely a broader range of intensity values within those labeled regions, indicating more variability among the pixels representing those tissues.

### Code Summary

Here’s a concise summary of the variance calculations:

```python
# Variance for all pixels
var_all = ndi.variance(vol)
print('All pixels:', var_all)

# Variance for labeled pixels
var_labels = ndi.variance(vol, labels)
print('Labeled pixels:', var_labels)

# Variance for each object
var_objects = ndi.variance(vol, labels, index=[1,2])
print('Left ventricle:', var_objects[0])
print('Other tissue:', var_objects[1])
```

- **`var_all`** captures the variance across the entire image volume, including all pixel values.
- **`var_labels`** calculates the variance specifically for the regions defined by the `labels` array, focusing on those that have been segmented.
- **`var_objects`** assesses the variance for specific labeled objects (like the left ventricle and other tissues) as indicated by their corresponding indices.

### Conclusion

Understanding the variances helps in analyzing the characteristics of different tissues within medical imaging, where lower or higher variances can indicate different physical or pathological conditions. The provided interpretations clarify how the variance values relate to the number and distribution of pixel intensities in different regions of the image.

Great thinking. Often, global measurements are only useful for understanding the range and distribution of the data.
