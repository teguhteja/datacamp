# Extract objects

Extract objects
Extracting objects from the original image eliminates unrelated pixels and provides new images that can be analyzed independently.

The key is to crop images so that they only include the object of interest. The range of pixel indices that encompass the object is the bounding box.

For this exercise, use ndi.find_objects() to create a new image containing only the left ventricle.

Instructions 1/3
Create the labels array from mask, then create a mask left ventricle pixels. (Use the coordinates 128, 128 to find the left ventricle label value.)

# Create left ventricle mask
labels, nlabels = ____
lv_val = ____
lv_mask = np.where(____, 1, 0)

To extract the left ventricle object from the labeled array, you can follow these steps:

### Code Snippet

```python
# Create left ventricle mask
labels, nlabels = ndi.label(mask)  # Label the objects in the mask
lv_val = labels[128, 128]  # Get the label value for the left ventricle at the center pixel
lv_mask = np.where(labels == lv_val, 1, 0)  # Create a mask for the left ventricle
```

### Explanation of Each Line

1. **Label the Mask:**
   - `labels, nlabels = ndi.label(mask)` labels each separate object in the `mask`, where `labels` contains the labeled objects and `nlabels` is the number of labels found.

2. **Identify the Left Ventricle Label:**
   - `lv_val = labels[128, 128]` retrieves the label value of the pixel located at (128, 128), which corresponds to the left ventricle.

3. **Create the Left Ventricle Mask:**
   - `lv_mask = np.where(labels == lv_val, 1, 0)` generates a binary mask where pixels matching the left ventricle label (`lv_val`) are set to 1, while all other pixels are set to 0.

This code prepares the binary mask of the left ventricle, which can be further used for extraction or analysis.

Certainly! Let's break down the provided code step by step to understand what each part does in the context of image processing and segmentation:

### Code Breakdown

```python
# Create left ventricle mask
labels, nlabels = ndi.label(mask)
```
- **Purpose:** This line uses the `ndi.label()` function from the SciPy library to assign unique labels to connected components in the binary mask (named `mask`).
- **Input:** The `mask` is expected to be a binary image where the regions of interest (in this case, the left ventricle) are marked with 1s (or True) and the background is marked with 0s (or False).
- **Output:** The `labels` array contains the same dimensions as `mask`, where each connected component (object) is assigned a unique integer label. The variable `nlabels` holds the total number of distinct labeled objects found in the mask.

```python
lv_val = labels[128, 128]
```
- **Purpose:** This line retrieves the label value corresponding to the pixel located at the coordinates (128, 128) in the `labels` array.
- **Significance:** The pixel at this position is assumed to be within the left ventricle, which allows us to identify which label corresponds to the left ventricle.

```python
lv_mask = np.where(labels == lv_val, 1, 0)
```
- **Purpose:** This line creates a new binary mask (`lv_mask`) where all pixels belonging to the left ventricle (identified by `lv_val`) are set to 1, and all other pixels are set to 0.
- **Functionality:** `np.where()` is used to check each pixel in the `labels` array. If the pixel's label matches `lv_val`, it assigns a value of 1; otherwise, it assigns a value of 0. This results in a mask that clearly delineates the left ventricle from the background.

### Finding the Bounding Box

```python
# Find bounding box of left ventricle
bboxes = ndi.find_objects(lv_mask)
```
- **Purpose:** This line uses the `ndi.find_objects()` function to find the bounding boxes of labeled objects in the binary mask (`lv_mask`).
- **Output:** The variable `bboxes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains slices (indices) representing the bounding box for each labeled object found in `lv_mask`. Each slice specifies the range of indices along each dimension that contains the object.

### Output Information

```python
print('Number of objects:', len(bboxes))
print('Indices for first box:', bboxes[0])
```
- **Purpose:** These lines print out two pieces of information:
  - **Number of objects:** The total count of distinct objects found in the mask, which corresponds to the number of bounding boxes detected. This gives insight into how many connected regions were identified.
  - **Indices for the first box:** The first bounding box is printed, which shows the indices (slices) of the pixels that encompass the first detected object (the left ventricle, in this case). This information is crucial for cropping or analyzing the specific region of interest further.

### Summary
In summary, this code segment is part of an image processing workflow that aims to identify and segment the left ventricle in a medical imaging context. By labeling connected components, creating a specific mask for the left ventricle, and finding its bounding box, it allows for subsequent analysis or extraction of this critical anatomical structure from the image.
