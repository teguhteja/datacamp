# Calculate distance

Calculate distance
A distance transformation calculates the distance from each pixel to a given point, usually the nearest background pixel. This allows you to determine which points in the object are more interior and which are closer to edges.

For this exercise, use the Euclidian distance transform on the left ventricle object in labels.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a mask of left ventricle pixels (Value of 1 in labels).
Calculate the distance to background for each pixel using ndi.distance_transform_edt(). Supply pixel dimensions to the sampling argument.
Print out the maximum distance and its coordinates using ndi.maximum and ndi.maximum_position.
Overlay a slice of the distance map on the original image. This has been done for you.

# Calculate left ventricle distances
lv = np.where(____, 1, 0)
dists = ____

# Report on distances
print('Max distance (mm):', ____)
print('Max location:', ____)

# Plot overlay of distances
overlay = np.where(dists[5] > 0, dists[5], np.nan) 
plt.imshow(overlay, cmap='hot')
format_and_render_plot()

To calculate the distance from each pixel in the left ventricle to the nearest background pixel, you'll need to follow the instructions provided. Below is how you can implement this in Python, filling in the placeholders for calculating the left ventricle distances, reporting maximum distance, and plotting the overlay:

### Step-by-Step Implementation:

1. **Create a mask for left ventricle pixels:** Use the `np.where()` function to create a binary mask where left ventricle pixels are represented as 1 and others as 0.
2. **Calculate the distance transform:** Use `ndi.distance_transform_edt()` to compute the distance from each left ventricle pixel to the nearest background pixel, providing the pixel dimensions via the `sampling` argument.
3. **Find and print the maximum distance and its coordinates:** Use `ndi.maximum` and `ndi.maximum_position` to find these values.
4. **Plot the overlay of the distances on the original image.**

Hereâ€™s how the complete code will look:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import ndimage as ndi

# Assuming 'labels' is your labeled array and 'vol' contains your volume data

# 1. Create a mask of left ventricle pixels
lv = np.where(labels == 1, 1, 0)

# 2. Calculate the distance to background for each pixel
# Get the voxel size from vol.meta
sampling = vol.meta['sampling']  # e.g., [dx, dy, dz] in mm
dists = ndi.distance_transform_edt(lv, sampling=sampling)

# 3. Report on distances
max_distance = ndi.maximum(dists)
max_location = ndi.maximum_position(dists)

print('Max distance (mm):', max_distance)
print('Max location:', max_location)

# 4. Plot overlay of distances
overlay = np.where(dists[5] > 0, dists[5], np.nan)  # Assuming you want to visualize the 5th slice
plt.imshow(overlay, cmap='hot')
plt.colorbar(label='Distance (mm)')
plt.title('Overlay of Distance Transform on Slice 5')
plt.show()
format_and_render_plot()
```

### Breakdown of the Code:
- **Mask Creation:** `lv` is a binary array where pixels belonging to the left ventricle are set to 1.
- **Distance Calculation:** `dists` contains the Euclidean distance from each pixel in the left ventricle to the nearest background pixel, with dimensions given in millimeters.
- **Maximum Distance and Location:** The maximum distance and its coordinates in the array are printed for insight.
- **Plotting:** The distance map for a specific slice (in this case, slice 5) is visualized with a hot color map.

### Conclusion:
By running this code, you will obtain the maximum distance of the left ventricle from the nearest background pixel, its coordinates, and a visual overlay of the distance transform on the original image slice. This helps in understanding the spatial distribution of distances within the left ventricle.
