# Separate histograms




Separate histograms
A poor tissue segmentation includes multiple tissue types, leading to a wide distribution of intensity values and more variance.

On the other hand, a perfectly segmented left ventricle would contain only blood-related pixels, so the histogram of the segmented values should be roughly bell-shaped.

For this exercise, compare the intensity distributions within vol for the listed sets of pixels. Use ndi.histogram, which also accepts labels and index arguments.

Use the labels and index arguments to extract a histogram for each of the following set of pixels in vol:

All pixels
All labeled pixels
Left ventricle pixels (i.e., label 1)

# Create histograms for selected pixels
hist1 = ndi.histogram(vol, min=0, max=255, bins=256)
hist2 = ndi.histogram(vol, 0, 255, 256, labels=____)
hist3 = ndi.histogram(vol, 0, 255, 256, labels=____, index=____)

To create histograms for the specified sets of pixels in your volume (`vol`), you'll want to utilize the `ndi.histogram` function from the `scipy.ndimage` library. Here’s how to structure the code to create the required histograms:

1. **All pixels:** This will include all the pixels in the `vol`.
2. **All labeled pixels:** This will include pixels that have been assigned labels (you need to specify the labels).
3. **Left ventricle pixels (label 1):** This will specifically look for pixels labeled as `1`, which corresponds to the left ventricle.

Here's how you can fill in the code for these histograms:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import ndimage as ndi

# Assuming vol is your volume array and labels is your labeled array

# 1. Create histogram for all pixels
hist1 = ndi.histogram(vol, min=0, max=255, bins=256)

# 2. Create histogram for all labeled pixels
# Here we assume labels is an array containing the label for each pixel in vol
hist2 = ndi.histogram(vol, 0, 255, 256, labels=labels)

# 3. Create histogram for left ventricle pixels (label 1)
hist3 = ndi.histogram(vol, 0, 255, 256, labels=labels, index=1)

# The variables hist1, hist2, and hist3 now contain the histogram data.
```

### Breakdown:
- **`hist1`:** This histogram encompasses all pixel values ranging from 0 to 255.
- **`hist2`:** This histogram extracts pixel intensity distributions for all labeled pixels in `vol`.
- **`hist3`:** This histogram specifically filters for pixel values in the left ventricle using the label index of `1`.

### Conclusion
This structure allows you to compare the intensity distributions across all pixels, labeled pixels, and specifically the left ventricle pixels, enabling a better understanding of the segmentation quality in your image analysis task.

Plot each histogram using plt.plot(). For each one, rescale by the total number of pixels to allow comparisons between them.

# Create histograms for selected pixels
hist1 = ndi.histogram(vol, min=0, max=255, bins=256)
hist2 = ndi.histogram(vol, 0, 255, 256, labels=labels)
hist3 = ndi.histogram(vol, 0, 255, 256, labels=labels, index=1)

# Plot the histogram density
plt.plot(hist1 / hist1.sum(), label='All pixels')
plt.plot(____, label='All labeled pixels')
plt.plot(____, label='Left ventricle')
format_and_render_plot()


To plot the histograms for the different sets of pixels and rescale them by the total number of pixels, you can follow the code structure below. The histograms for labeled pixels and left ventricle pixels will be normalized in the same way as `hist1`. Here’s how to complete your code:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import ndimage as ndi

# Assuming vol is your volume array and labels is your labeled array

# Create histograms for selected pixels
hist1 = ndi.histogram(vol, min=0, max=255, bins=256)
hist2 = ndi.histogram(vol, 0, 255, 256, labels=labels)
hist3 = ndi.histogram(vol, 0, 255, 256, labels=labels, index=1)

# Plot the histogram density
plt.plot(hist1 / hist1.sum(), label='All pixels')  # Normalized histogram for all pixels
plt.plot(hist2 / hist2.sum(), label='All labeled pixels')  # Normalized histogram for all labeled pixels
plt.plot(hist3 / hist3.sum(), label='Left ventricle')  # Normalized histogram for left ventricle pixels

# Formatting and rendering the plot
format_and_render_plot()
```

### Explanation:
- **Normalization:** Each histogram is divided by its total sum to obtain a density representation, which allows for a fair comparison between the different sets of pixels.
- **`plt.plot()`:** This function is used to plot the normalized histograms, with each histogram labeled accordingly.
- **Plot Formatting:** The plot includes a title, x-label, y-label, legend, and grid for better readability.

### Conclusion:
This code will generate a single plot displaying the intensity distributions of all pixels, all labeled pixels, and the left ventricle pixels, allowing for an easy visual comparison of the histograms.
