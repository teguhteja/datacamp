# Pinpoint center of mass

Pinpoint center of mass
The distance transformation reveals the most embedded portions of an object. On the other hand, ndi.center_of_mass() returns the coordinates for the center of an object.

The "mass" corresponds to intensity values, with higher values pulling the center closer to it.

For this exercise, calculate the center of mass for the two labeled areas. Then, plot them on top of the image.

Using vol and labels, calculate the center of mass for the two labeled objects. Print the coordinates.
Use plt.scatter() to add the center of mass markers to the plot. Note that scatterplots draw from the bottom-left corner. Image columns correspond to x values and rows to y values.

# Extract centers of mass for objects 1 and 2
coms = ____
print('Label 1 center:', ____)
print('Label 2 center:', ____)

# Add marks to plot
for c0, c1, c2 in coms:
    plt.scatter(____, ____, s=100, marker='o')
plt.show()

Thank you for the clarification! You’re right—`ndi.center_of_mass()` returns the coordinates in the order of **[z, x, y]** (depth, row, column) instead of **[row, column]** used for image plotting.

### Adjusted Code
Given that, we need to switch the way we use the coordinates when plotting. Here’s the corrected code that ensures we interpret the coordinates correctly:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import ndimage as ndi

# Assuming 'vol' is your volume data and 'labels' is your labeled array

# 1. Extract centers of mass for objects 1 and 2
coms = [ndi.center_of_mass(vol, labels=labels, index=i) for i in [1, 2]]

# 2. Print the coordinates
print('Label 1 center:', coms[0])  # This will give [z, x, y]
print('Label 2 center:', coms[1])  # This will give [z, x, y]

# 3. Add marks to plot
slice_index = 5  # Assuming you want to visualize the 5th slice
plt.imshow(vol[slice_index], cmap='gray')  # Plot the slice of the original image

# Correctly use com[1] for the x-coordinate (column) and com[2] for the y-coordinate (row)
for com in coms:
    plt.scatter(com[2], com[1], s=100, marker='o', color='red')  # com[2] is x and com[1] is y

plt.title('Centers of Mass Overlay')
plt.colorbar(label='Intensity')
plt.show()
```

### Key Changes:
- **Coordinates for Plotting:** When calling `plt.scatter()`, use:
  - `com[2]` for the x-coordinate (column index).
  - `com[1]` for the y-coordinate (row index).

### Explanation:
- **Center of Mass Coordinates:** The output from `ndi.center_of_mass()` gives you the **[z, x, y]** coordinates, which means:
  - **z**: The slice index (depth).
  - **x**: The vertical position (row).
  - **y**: The horizontal position (column).

### Conclusion:
By following these adjustments, the centers of mass should now be plotted correctly on the specified slice of the image, and the coordinates will match the expected values. If you run this code, it should resolve the issues with plotting and give you the correct centers of mass overlay.
