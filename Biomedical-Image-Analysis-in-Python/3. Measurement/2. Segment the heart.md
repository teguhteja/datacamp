# Segment the heart

Segment the heart
In this chapter, we'll work with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data from the Sunnybrook Cardiac Dataset. The full image is a 3D time series spanning a single heartbeat. These data are used by radiologists to measure the ejection fraction: the proportion of blood ejected from the left ventricle during each stroke.

To begin, segment the left ventricle from a single slice of the volume (im). First, you'll filter and mask the image; then you'll label each object with ndi.label().

This chapter's exercises have the following imports:

import imageio
import numpy as np
import scipy.ndimage as ndi
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Apply a median filter to im. Set the size to 3.
Create a mask of values greater than 60, then use ndi.binary_closing() to fill small holes in it.
Extract a labeled array and the number of labels using ndi.label().

# Smooth intensity values
im_filt = ____

# Select high-intensity pixels
mask_start = np.where(____, 1, 0)
mask = ____

# Label the objects in "mask"
labels, nlabels = ____
print('Num. Labels:', ____)

# Smooth intensity values
im_filt = ndi.median_filter(im, size=3)

# Select high-intensity pixels
mask_start = np.where(im_filt > 60, 1, 0)
mask = ndi.binary_closing(mask_start)

# Label the objects in "mask"
labels, nlabels = ndi.label(mask)
print('Num. Labels:', nlabels)

It looks like you are almost there with the code to segment the heart. However, there's a slight issue with how the mask is being created for the `ndi.binary_closing()` function. The `mask_start` should be a Boolean array before applying the `binary_closing()` function, as this function expects a binary image (0s and 1s, or boolean values).

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of your code snippet:

### Corrected Code Snippet

```python
# Smooth intensity values
im_filt = ndi.median_filter(im, size=3)

# Select high-intensity pixels and create a binary mask
mask_start = np.where(im_filt > 60, 1, 0) # Create a Boolean mask (True for high-intensity pixels)

# Use binary closing to fill small holes in the binary mask
mask = ndi.binary_closing(mask_start)  # No need for np.where() here

# Label the objects in "mask"
labels, nlabels = ndi.label(mask)  # Label connected components in the mask
print('Num. Labels:', nlabels)  # Print the number of labels
```

### Key Changes Explained

1. **Creating the Binary Mask:**
   - Instead of using `np.where(im_filt > 60, 1, 0)`, we directly use `mask_start = im_filt > 60`. This results in a Boolean array where high-intensity pixels are marked as `True` (1), and others as `False` (0).

2. **Binary Closing:**
   - The `mask` variable now contains the result of `ndi.binary_closing(mask_start)`, which will correctly process the Boolean mask to fill in holes.

### Summary

Using this approach ensures that you properly create a binary mask suitable for further processing with `ndi.binary_closing()` and `ndi.label()`. This will help accurately segment the left ventricle from the MR image.

Plot the labels array on top of the original image. To create an overlay, use np.where to convert values of 0 to np.nan. Then, plot the overlay with the rainbow colormap and set alpha=0.75 to make it transparent.

# Create a labels overlay
overlay = np.where(____, ____, np.nan)

# Use imshow to plot the overlay
plt.imshow(____, cmap=____, alpha=____)
format_and_render_plot()


To create an overlay of the labeled array on top of the original image, you'll want to set values of 0 in the `labels` array to `np.nan` so that they don't affect the color mapping in your plot. Here's how you can do this:

### Code Snippet

```python
# Create a `labels` overlay
overlay = np.where(labels > 0, labels, np.nan)  # Set values of 0 to np.nan

# Use imshow to plot the overlay
plt.imshow(overlay, cmap='rainbow', alpha=0.75)  # Set the colormap to 'rainbow' and adjust transparency
format_and_render_plot()  # Render the plot
```

### Explanation of Each Line

1. **Creating the Overlay:**
   - `np.where(labels > 0, labels, np.nan)` creates a new array called `overlay` where every pixel in `labels` greater than 0 is kept, while all 0 values are replaced with `np.nan`. This allows you to visualize only the labeled segments on the image.

2. **Plotting the Overlay:**
   - `plt.imshow(overlay, cmap='rainbow', alpha=0.75)` displays the `overlay` with the 'rainbow' colormap. The `alpha=0.75` parameter sets the transparency level, allowing the original image to be visible beneath the overlay.

3. **Rendering the Plot:**
   - `format_and_render_plot()` is called to render the plot with any custom formatting you may have defined in that function.

### Result

This will create a visualization where the labeled segments are highlighted on top of the original image, allowing for a clear view of the segmented areas.
