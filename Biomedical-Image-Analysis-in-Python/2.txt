Cut image processing to the bone by transforming x-ray images. You'll learn how to exploit intensity patterns to select sub-regions of an array, and you'll use convolutional filters to detect interesting features. You'll also use SciPy's ndimage module, which contains a treasure trove of image processing tools.
