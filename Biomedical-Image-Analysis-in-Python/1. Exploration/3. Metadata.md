# Metadata

Metadata
ImageIO reads in data as Image objects. These are standard NumPy arrays with a dictionary of metadata.

Metadata can be quite rich in medical images and can include:

Patient demographics: name, age, sex, clinical information
Acquisition information: image shape, sampling rates, data type, modality (such as X-Ray, CT or MRI)
Start this exercise by reading in the chest image and listing the available fields in the meta dictionary.

After reading in the image, use im.meta to select the true statement from the list below.

Read in the image, "chest-220.dcm".
Print the available keys in the metadata dictionary. Use the the keys() method of im.meta.

```py
# Import ImageIO and load image
____
im = ____

# Print the available metadata fields
print(____)


```

Here's how you can load the DICOM image and print the available metadata keys using `imageio`:

```py
# Import ImageIO and load image
import imageio
im = imageio.imread("chest-220.dcm")

# Print the available metadata fields
print(im.meta.keys())
```

### Explanation:
1. `imageio.imread()` reads the image and also captures its metadata.
2. `im.meta.keys()` retrieves the keys of the metadata dictionary, allowing you to explore the available metadata fields like patient demographics, acquisition info, etc.

Make sure the file `chest-220.dcm` is available in your working directory for the code to execute successfully.
