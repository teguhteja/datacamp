# Load images

Load images
In this chapter, we'll work with sections of a computed tomography (CT) scan from The Cancer Imaging Archive. CT uses a rotating X-ray tube to create a 3D image of the target area.

The actual content of the image depends on the instrument used: photographs measure visible light, x-ray and CT measure radiation absorbance, and MRI scanners measure magnetic fields.

To warm up, use the imageio package to load a single DICOM image from the scan volume and check out a few of its attributes.

Instructions

Import imageio.
Read in the image "chest-220.dcm" using the imread() function.
Print the type() and shape (number of pixels) of im.

```py
# Import ImageIO
import ____

# Load "chest-220.dcm"
im = ____

# Print image attributes
print('Image type:', ____)
print('Shape of image array:', im.____)


```

To complete this task, you'll need to import the `imageio` package and use it to read a DICOM image file. Here's the code with the missing parts filled in:

```py
# Import ImageIO
import imageio

# Load "chest-220.dcm"
im = imageio.imread("chest-220.dcm")

# Print image attributes
print('Image type:', type(im))
print('Shape of image array:', im.shape)
```

### Explanation:
1. `imageio` is imported to handle the loading of image files, including DICOM images.
2. The `imread()` function is used to read in the DICOM file.
3. The `type()` function prints the type of the loaded image (likely a NumPy array).
4. `im.shape` gives the dimensions of the image in pixels.

Make sure the file `chest-220.dcm` is available in your working directory for the code to execute successfully.
