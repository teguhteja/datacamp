# Load volumes

Load volumes
ImageIO's volread() function can load multi-dimensional datasets and create 3D volumes from a folder of images. It can also aggregate metadata across these multiple images.

For this exercise, read in an entire volume of brain data from the "tcia-chest-ct" folder, which contains 25 DICOM images.

Instructions
100 XP
Use volread() to load the directory, "tcia-chest-ct".
Print the available metadata using the keys() method of vol.meta.
Print the shape of the volume.


# Import ImageIO
____

# Load the "tcia-chest-ct" directory
vol = ____

# Print image attributes
print('Available metadata:', ____)
print('Shape of image array:', ____)

Here's how you can use `imageio` to load a 3D volume from a folder of DICOM images and inspect its metadata and shape:

```py
# Import ImageIO
import imageio

# Load the "tcia-chest-ct" directory
vol = imageio.volread("tcia-chest-ct")

# Print image attributes
print('Available metadata:', vol.meta.keys())
print('Shape of image array:', vol.shape)
```

### Explanation:
- `imageio.volread("tcia-chest-ct")`: This reads the entire directory of DICOM images and creates a 3D volume.
- `vol.meta.keys()`: Retrieves the keys for the metadata associated with the volume.
- `vol.shape`: Prints the shape of the 3D image array.
