# Plot images

Plot images
Perhaps the most critical principle of image analysis is: look at your images!

Matplotlib's imshow() function gives you a simple way to do this. Knowing a few simple arguments will help:

cmap controls the color mappings for each value. The "gray" colormap is common, but many others are available.
vmin and vmax control the color contrast between values. Changing these can reduce the influence of extreme values.
plt.axis('off') removes axis and tick labels from the image.
For this exercise, plot the CT scan and investigate the effect of a few different parameters.

Set the stage by importing packages and loading the CT scan. matplotlib.pyplot is often loaded as plt.

```py
# Import ImageIO and PyPlot 
____
import ____ as plt

# Read in "chest-220.dcm"
im = ____

```

Here's the code to import the necessary packages, read the DICOM image, and set up for plotting:

```py
# Import ImageIO and PyPlot
import imageio
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read in "chest-220.dcm"
im = imageio.imread("chest-220.dcm")
```



This sets the stage for plotting the image using `matplotlib`. In the next steps, you can use `plt.imshow()` to display the image and modify its appearance (e.g., colormap, contrast).

Draw the image with plt.imshow(), selecting the "gray" colormap. Call plt.show() to render the image.

# Draw the image in grayscale
____(____, cmap=____)

# Render the image
plt.show()

Here’s how you can display the DICOM image in grayscale using `plt.imshow()` and `plt.show()`:

```py
# Draw the image in grayscale
plt.imshow(im, cmap="gray")

# Render the image
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:
- `plt.imshow(im, cmap="gray")`: This function displays the image using the grayscale colormap.
- `plt.show()`: This renders the image in the output.

Make sure the image `chest-220.dcm` is loaded properly for this code to display the image.


Draw the image in grayscale. Also, set vmin=-200 and vmax=200 to increase the contrast (i.e., the distance between the brightest and darkest colors is smaller than before).
# Draw the image with greater contrast
____

# Render the image
____
Here's how you can display the image in grayscale while setting the contrast using `vmin` and `vmax`:

```py
# Draw the image with greater contrast
plt.imshow(im, cmap="gray", vmin=-200, vmax=200)

# Render the image
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:
- `vmin=-200` and `vmax=200`: These parameters control the color contrast, limiting the range of pixel intensity values displayed, making subtle differences in the image more visible.
- `plt.show()`: Renders the image for viewing.

This will adjust the contrast and display the CT scan in grayscale.

Turn axis ticks and labels off.

# Remove axis ticks and labels
____

# Render the image
____

Here’s how you can remove the axis ticks and labels before rendering the image:

```py
# Remove axis ticks and labels
plt.axis('off')

# Render the image
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:
- `plt.axis('off')`: This command hides the axis ticks and labels for a cleaner image display.
- `plt.show()`: Displays the modified image.
