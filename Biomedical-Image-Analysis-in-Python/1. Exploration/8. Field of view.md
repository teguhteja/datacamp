# Field of view

Field of view
The amount of physical space covered by an image is its field of view, which is calculated from two properties:

Array shape, the number of data elements on each axis. Can be accessed with the shape attribute.
Sampling resolution, the amount of physical space covered by each pixel. Sometimes available in metadata (e.g., meta['sampling']).
For this exercise, multiply the array shape and sampling resolution along each axis to calculate the field of view of vol. All values are in millimeters.

(25, 512, 512)

(50, 1024, 1024)

(82, 500, 500)

(3.27, 0.97, 0.97)

To calculate the field of view (FOV) of the volume, you need to multiply the dimensions of the array (from `vol.shape`) by the sampling resolution (from the metadata, likely under `meta['sampling']`).

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step process for calculating the field of view:

```py
# Import ImageIO
import imageio

# Load the "tcia-chest-ct" directory
vol = imageio.volread("tcia-chest-ct")

# Extract shape of the volume (array shape)
volume_shape = vol.shape

# Extract sampling resolution from metadata
sampling_resolution = vol.meta.get('sampling', (1, 1, 1))  # Default to (1, 1, 1) if not found

# Calculate the field of view by multiplying shape by sampling resolution
fov = tuple(dim * res for dim, res in zip(volume_shape, sampling_resolution))

# Print the results
print('Volume shape:', volume_shape)
print('Sampling resolution:', sampling_resolution)
print('Field of view (in mm):', fov)
```

### Explanation:
- `volume_shape`: This is the number of data elements (pixels) along each axis, accessed from `vol.shape`.
- `sampling_resolution`: This is the resolution of each pixel, which you can usually find in the metadata under `'sampling'`. A default value of `(1, 1, 1)` is used if the sampling isn't found.
- The field of view (FOV) is calculated by multiplying the corresponding dimensions of the shape and sampling resolution for each axis.

### Possible Outputs:
- If `vol.shape` is `(25, 512, 512)` and `sampling_resolution` is `(3.27, 0.97, 0.97)`, then:
  - FOV would be approximately `(25 * 3.27, 512 * 0.97, 512 * 0.97)` -> `(82, 500, 500)`.
  
Hence, the correct answer from the provided options would likely be **(82, 500, 500)**, assuming the resolution matches.
