# Intersection of the union

Intersection of the union
Another cost function is the intersection of the union (IOU). The IOU is the number of pixels filled in both images (the intersection) out of the number of pixels filled in either image (the union).

For this exercise, determine how best to transform im1 to maximize the IOU cost function with im2. We have defined the following function for you:

def intersection_of_union(im1, im2):
    i = np.logical_and(im1, im2)
    u = np.logical_or(im1, im2)
    return i.sum() / u.sum()
Note: When using ndi.rotate(), remember to pass reshape=False, so that array shapes match.

Shift (-10, -10), rotate -15 deg.

Shift (10, 10), rotate -15 deg.

Shift (10, 10), rotate +15 deg.

Shift (-10, -10), rotate +15 deg.


To solve this problem, we need to transform `im1` and compare it to `im2` using the **Intersection Over Union (IOU)** cost function. The goal is to maximize the IOU by shifting and rotating `im1` to align it with `im2`. 

We can try different transformations and calculate the IOU for each one, selecting the combination of shifts and rotations that gives the highest IOU.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Apply Shift and Rotation to `im1`:**
   - Use `ndi.shift()` to shift `im1` by the specified number of pixels (e.g., `(-10, -10)` or `(10, 10)`).
   - Use `ndi.rotate()` to rotate `im1` by the specified degrees (e.g., `-15` or `+15`). Remember to set `reshape=False` to preserve the image shape.

2. **Calculate IOU:** 
   - The IOU is calculated using the provided `intersection_of_union()` function.
   - Compare the results for different transformations to see which one gives the highest IOU.

### Code to Test Each Transformation:

```python
# Provided IOU function
def intersection_of_union(im1, im2):
    i = np.logical_and(im1, im2)  # Intersection of filled pixels
    u = np.logical_or(im1, im2)   # Union of filled pixels
    return i.sum() / u.sum()

# Test different shifts and rotations
transforms = [
    ((-10, -10), -15),
    ((10, 10), -15),
    ((10, 10), 15),
    ((-10, -10), 15)
]

# Loop through transformations, apply them, and calculate IOU
for shift, angle in transforms:
    transformed_im1 = ndi.shift(im1, shift=shift)
    transformed_im1 = ndi.rotate(transformed_im1, angle=angle, reshape=False)
    iou = intersection_of_union(transformed_im1, im2)
    print(f'Shift: {shift}, Rotate: {angle} degrees, IOU: {iou:.4f}')
```

### Explanation:
1. **Transformations:**
   - The four transformations tested here involve combinations of shifts (left/up or right/down) and rotations (clockwise or counterclockwise).
   
2. **IOU Calculation:**
   - For each transformation, we shift and rotate `im1` and then calculate the IOU by comparing it with `im2`.

3. **Result:**
   - The transformation that gives the highest IOU will indicate the best alignment of `im1` with `im2`.

### Expected Outcome:
You will get the IOU values for each transformation, and you can select the transformation with the highest IOU as the one that best aligns the two images.
