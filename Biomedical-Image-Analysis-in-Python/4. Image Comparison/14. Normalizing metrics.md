# Normalizing metrics

Normalizing metrics
We previously saw that there was not a significant difference between the brain volumes of elderly individuals with and without Alzheimer's Disease.

But could a correlated measure, such as "skull volume" be masking the differences?

For this exercise, calculate a new test statistic for the comparison of brain volume between groups, after adjusting for the subject's skull size.

Using results.statistic and results.pvalue as your guide, answer the question: Is there strong evidence that Alzheimer's Disease is marked by smaller brain size, relative to skull size?

Import ttest_ind from scipy.stats.
Divide each patient's brain_vol by their skull_vol to create a normalized measure.
Extract the adjusted brain measures from each group using df.loc.
Calculate the t-statistic and p-value using ttest_ind. Be sure to pass in brain_alz first, followed by

# Import independent two-sample t-test
____

# Divide `df.brain_vol` by `df.skull_vol`
df['adj_brain_vol'] = ____

# Select brain measures by Alzheimers group
brain_alz = df.loc[df.alzheimers == ____, 'adj_brain_vol']
brain_typ = df.loc[____, 'adj_brain_vol']

# Evaluate null hypothesis
results = ____

To determine whether there is strong evidence that Alzheimer's Disease is marked by smaller brain size relative to skull size, you can perform a two-sample t-test on the adjusted brain volume measures. Here’s how to complete the code step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Code Explanation

1. **Import the T-Test Function**: Import `ttest_ind` from `scipy.stats`.
2. **Normalize Brain Volume**: Create a new column in the DataFrame that divides each patient's brain volume by their skull volume.
3. **Extract Adjusted Measures**: Extract the adjusted brain volume measures for both Alzheimer's and typical elderly groups.
4. **Perform the T-Test**: Use `ttest_ind` to compare the two groups.

Here’s how the code looks:

```python
# Import independent two-sample t-test
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

# Divide `df.brain_vol` by `df.skull_vol`
df['adj_brain_vol'] = df['brain_vol'] / df['skull_vol']

# Select brain measures by Alzheimer's group
brain_alz = df.loc[df['alzheimers'] == True, 'adj_brain_vol']
brain_typ = df.loc[df['alzheimers'] == False, 'adj_brain_vol']

# Evaluate null hypothesis
results = ttest_ind(brain_alz, brain_typ)

# Print results
print('t-statistic:', results.statistic)
print('p-value:', results.pvalue)
```

### Explanation of Each Line

1. **Import Statement**:
   - The `from scipy.stats import ttest_ind` imports the function needed for performing the t-test.

2. **Normalization**:
   - `df['adj_brain_vol'] = df['brain_vol'] / df['skull_vol']`: This line creates a new column called `adj_brain_vol`, which is the ratio of brain volume to skull volume for each patient. This normalization helps to account for skull size when evaluating brain size.

3. **Group Selection**:
   - `brain_alz = df.loc[df['alzheimers'] == True, 'adj_brain_vol']`: This line extracts the adjusted brain volume values for Alzheimer's patients.
   - `brain_typ = df.loc[df['alzheimers'] == False, 'adj_brain_vol']`: This line extracts the adjusted brain volume values for typical elderly patients.

4. **T-Test Evaluation**:
   - `results = ttest_ind(brain_alz, brain_typ)`: This line performs the independent two-sample t-test comparing the adjusted brain volume between the two groups.

5. **Output**:
   - The results are printed, showing the t-statistic and p-value. These values indicate whether there is a statistically significant difference between the brain volumes of the two groups.

### Interpretation of Results

- If the **p-value** is less than the significance level (commonly set at 0.05), you can reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that there is a significant difference in the adjusted brain volume between Alzheimer's and typical elderly groups.
- The **t-statistic** indicates the direction and magnitude of the difference. A negative t-statistic would suggest that the Alzheimer's group has a smaller adjusted brain volume compared to the typical elderly group.

### Conclusion

Using this analysis, you can assess whether there is strong evidence that Alzheimer's Disease is associated with smaller brain size when normalized for skull size.


<script.py> output:
    t-statistic: -5.850136931483199
    p-value: 2.190279428499085e-08


Possible answers


No, the p-value is greater than 0.05.

Yes, reject the null hypothesis!

No, the t-statistic is negative.

No, the p-value is too small.

Based on the output you provided from the t-test:

- **t-statistic**: -5.850136931483199
- **p-value**: 2.190279428499085e-08

### Analysis of the Results:

1. **P-Value**: 
   - The p-value (approximately \(2.19 \times 10^{-8}\)) is significantly less than 0.05. This indicates that there is a statistically significant difference between the adjusted brain volume of Alzheimer's patients and typical elderly individuals.

2. **T-Statistic**:
   - The negative t-statistic (-5.85) suggests that the mean adjusted brain volume of Alzheimer's patients is lower than that of typical elderly individuals.

### Conclusion:
Given this information, the correct answer to the question "Is there strong evidence that Alzheimer's Disease is marked by smaller brain size, relative to skull size?" is:

**Yes, reject the null hypothesis!** 

### Final Answer:
**Yes, reject the null hypothesis!**
