# Mean absolute error

Mean absolute error
Cost functions and objective functions output a single value that summarizes how well two images match.

The mean absolute error (MAE), for example, summarizes intensity differences between two images, with higher values indicating greater divergence.

For this exercise, calculate the mean absolute error between im1 and im2 step-by-step.

Calculate the difference between im1 and im2.
Plot err with the seismic colormap. To center the colormap at 0, set vmin=-200 and vmax=200.

# Plot the difference

### To calculate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between two images `im1` and `im2`, we will follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

#### 1. **Calculate Image Difference:**
   - **Goal:** To find the pixel-wise difference between the two images.
   - **Operation:** Subtract `im2` from `im1`.

   ```python
   err = im1 - im2
   ```

#### 2. **Plot the Difference:**
   - **Goal:** Visualize the pixel differences between the images using a colormap.
   - **Operation:** Use `plt.imshow()` to plot the `err` matrix (difference) with the **seismic** colormap.
   - **`vmin=-200` and `vmax=200`:** These set the intensity range, with the center of the colormap at 0. This highlights positive and negative differences between the two images.

   ```python
   plt.imshow(err, cmap='seismic', vmin=-200, vmax=200)
   ```

#### 3. **Format and Render the Plot:**
   - **Goal:** Make sure the plot looks clean and presentable by calling a predefined function to handle layout.
   - **Operation:** Call `format_and_render_plot()` to finalize and render the visualizations.

   ```python
   format_and_render_plot()
   ```

### Complete Code:

```python
# Calculate image difference
err = im1 - im2

# Plot the difference using a seismic colormap with centered values
plt.imshow(err, cmap='seismic', vmin=-200, vmax=200)

# Formatting and rendering the plot
format_and_render_plot()
```

### Summary:
- The **difference** between two images is calculated pixel by pixel.
- The **seismic colormap** is used to visualize the differences with blue representing negative values (where `im1` is darker) and red representing positive values (where `im1` is brighter).
- **MAE** is useful for quantifying how different two images are, with higher values indicating more significant intensity differences between the two images.


Compute the absolute error of the difference. Use np.abs(). Plot the image.

# Calculate absolute image difference
abs_err = ____(im1 - im2)

# Plot the difference
plt.imshow(____, cmap='seismic', vmin=-200, vmax=200)
format_and_render_plot()

### Explanation and Code for Calculating Absolute Error:

To compute the **absolute error** between two images, we need to take the absolute value of the pixel-wise differences between `im1` and `im2`. This ensures that all the values in the error matrix are non-negative.

### Step-by-Step:

#### 1. **Calculate Absolute Image Difference:**
   - **Goal:** Use `np.abs()` to calculate the absolute difference between `im1` and `im2`.
   - **Operation:** Subtract `im2` from `im1` and apply `np.abs()` to get non-negative values.

   ```python
   abs_err = np.abs(im1 - im2)
   ```

#### 2. **Plot the Absolute Difference:**
   - **Goal:** Visualize the absolute error using the **seismic colormap**.
   - **Operation:** Use `plt.imshow()` to plot `abs_err`. The colormap will still show differences, but since the absolute error is non-negative, the range will reflect the intensity of the differences only.

   ```python
   plt.imshow(abs_err, cmap='seismic', vmin=0, vmax=200)
   ```

#### 3. **Format and Render the Plot:**
   - **Goal:** Make sure the plot is correctly formatted and rendered for display.

   ```python
   format_and_render_plot()
   ```

### Complete Code:

```python
# Calculate absolute image difference
abs_err = np.abs(im1 - im2)

# Plot the absolute difference using a seismic colormap
plt.imshow(abs_err, cmap='seismic', vmin=-200, vmax=200)

# Formatting and rendering the plot
format_and_render_plot()
```

### Summary:
- **`np.abs()`** computes the absolute difference between two images to ensure the differences are non-negative.
- **Absolute error** helps to understand the magnitude of pixel-wise intensity differences between `im1` and `im2`.
- The **seismic colormap** still highlights areas with larger differences, but the negative values are now removed due to the absolute function.


Find the cost value using np.mean().

# Calculate mean absolute error
mean_abs_err = ____(np.abs(im1 - im2))
print('MAE:', ____)


To compute the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** between two images, we use `np.mean()` on the absolute differences between `im1` and `im2`. The MAE provides a single scalar value that summarizes the average pixel-wise difference between the images.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

#### 1. **Calculate Absolute Differences:**
   - Use `np.abs(im1 - im2)` to compute the absolute difference between `im1` and `im2`.

#### 2. **Find the Mean of Absolute Differences:**
   - Use `np.mean()` to compute the average of the absolute differences, which gives us the **MAE**.

### Code:

```python
# Calculate mean absolute error
mean_abs_err = np.mean(np.abs(im1 - im2))

# Print the mean absolute error (MAE)
print('MAE:', mean_abs_err)
```

### Summary:
- **`np.abs()`** computes the absolute pixel-wise differences between two images.
- **`np.mean()`** calculates the average of these differences, resulting in the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.
- The **MAE** is a useful metric for quantifying how different two images are, with higher values indicating greater divergence in pixel intensities.
