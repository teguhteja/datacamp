# Interpolation

Interpolation
Interpolation is how new pixel intensities are estimated when an image transformation is applied. It is implemented in SciPy using sets of spline functions.

Editing the interpolation order when using a function such as ndi.zoom() modifies the resulting estimate: higher orders provide more flexible estimates but take longer to compute.

For this exercise, upsample im and investigate the effect of different interpolation orders on the resulting image.

Use ndi.zoom() to upsample im from a shape of 128, 128 to 512, 512 twice. First, use an interpolation order of 0, then set order to 5.
Print the array shapes of im and up0.
Plot close-ups of the images. Use the index range 128:256 along each axis.

# Upsample "im" by a factor of 4
up0 = ndi.zoom(____, zoom=____, order=____)
up5 = ____

# Print original and new shape
print('Original shape:', ____)
print('Upsampled shape:', ____)

# Plot close-ups of the new images
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2)
axes[0].imshow(up0[128:256, 128:256])
axes[1].imshow(____)
format_and_render_plots()

### Explanation of the Code:

#### 1. **Upsampling the Image (`ndi.zoom()`):**
```python
up0 = ndi.zoom(im, zoom=4, order=0)
up5 = ndi.zoom(im, zoom=4, order=5)
```
- **`im`**: This is the original 2D brain image, assumed to have a shape of (128, 128).
- **`zoom=4`**: This quadruples the image size in both dimensions, increasing the shape from (128, 128) to (512, 512).
- **`order=0`**: Specifies the interpolation order. `order=0` uses **nearest-neighbor interpolation**, which is fast but may produce blocky or less smooth results.
- **`order=5`**: Specifies **higher-order spline interpolation**, which produces smoother results but is more computationally expensive.

#### 2. **Printing the Original and Upsampled Shapes:**
```python
print('Original shape:', im.shape)
print('Upsampled shape:', up0.shape)
```
- **`im.shape`**: This prints the shape of the original image, which is (128, 128).
- **`up0.shape`**: This prints the shape of the upsampled image, which will be (512, 512) after zooming by a factor of 4.

#### 3. **Plotting the Close-ups of Upsampled Images:**
```python
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2)
axes[0].imshow(up0[128:256, 128:256])
axes[1].imshow(up5[128:256, 128:256])
```
- **`plt.subplots(1, 2)`**: Creates a figure with **2 side-by-side subplots**. This allows for comparing the two different interpolations.
- **`up0[128:256, 128:256]`**: This is a **close-up** of a specific portion of the upsampled image, extracted using array slicing. It shows the central region of the image between rows 128 to 256 and columns 128 to 256.
- **`axes[0].imshow(up0[128:256, 128:256])`**: Plots the close-up of the **nearest-neighbor interpolated** image (`up0`).
- **`axes[1].imshow(up5[128:256, 128:256])`**: Plots the close-up of the **higher-order spline interpolated** image (`up5`).

#### 4. **Formatting and Rendering the Plot:**
```python
format_and_render_plots()
```
- This function likely formats and finalizes the rendering of the plots to ensure the layout looks clean and the images are displayed properly.

### Summary:
- **`ndi.zoom()`** is used to upsample the image by a factor of 4, increasing its size from (128, 128) to (512, 512).
- **Nearest-neighbor interpolation** (order=0) is compared to **higher-order spline interpolation** (order=5) by zooming in on a specific section of the image (128:256).
- The results are displayed side-by-side, allowing for a comparison between the blocky output of nearest-neighbor and the smooth output of the spline interpolation.

This code helps in understanding how different interpolation methods affect the quality of the upsampled image.
