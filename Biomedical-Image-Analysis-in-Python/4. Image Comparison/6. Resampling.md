# Resampling

Resampling
Images can be collected in a variety of shapes and sizes. Resampling is a useful tool when these shapes need to be made consistent. Two common applications are:

Downsampling: combining pixel data to decrease size
Upsampling: distributing pixel data to increase size
For this exercise, transform and then resample the brain image (im) to see how it affects image shape.

Shift im 20 pixels left and 20 pixels up, i.e. (-20, -20). Then, rotate it 35 degrees downward. Remember to specify a value for reshape.
Use ndi.zoom() to downsample the image from (256, 256) to (64, 64).

### Explanation and Steps for Resampling

In this exercise, you're working with two types of resampling: **downsampling** (reducing the resolution) and **upsampling** (increasing the resolution). First, the image is shifted and rotated, and then it's resampled to smaller and larger sizes. Let's go through the steps one by one.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. **Shift and Rotate the Image**
You need to shift the image by 20 pixels left and up, and rotate it by 35 degrees downward (clockwise).

```python
# Shift the image by (-20, -20) and rotate it by -35 degrees
xfm = ndi.shift(im, shift=(-20, -20))
xfm = ndi.rotate(xfm, angle=-35, reshape=False)
```

- **`ndi.shift(im, shift=(-20, -20))`**: This shifts the image `im` 20 pixels to the left and 20 pixels up.
- **`ndi.rotate(xfm, angle=-35, reshape=False)`**: Rotates the shifted image `xfm` by -35 degrees, keeping the original shape with `reshape=False`.

#### 2. **Downsample the Image**
To downsample the image from its original size (256, 256) to a smaller size (64, 64), you use `ndi.zoom()`. The zoom factor is calculated based on the desired size.

```python
# Downsample the image to (64, 64)
im_dn = ndi.zoom(xfm, zoom=64/256)
```

- **`ndi.zoom(xfm, zoom=64/256)`**: The `zoom` parameter defines the scaling factor. Since you want to downsample from 256x256 to 64x64, the zoom factor is `64/256 = 0.25`, meaning the image size is reduced by a factor of 4.

#### 3. **Upsample the Image**
Next, you upsample the image to a larger size (1024, 1024).

```python
# Upsample the image to (1024, 1024)
im_up = ndi.zoom(xfm, zoom=1024/256)
```

- **`ndi.zoom(xfm, zoom=1024/256)`**: The zoom factor for upsampling from 256x256 to 1024x1024 is `1024/256 = 4.0`, meaning the image is enlarged by a factor of 4.

#### 4. **Plot the Images**
Finally, the downsampled and upsampled images are plotted in two subplots for comparison.

```python
# Create subplots to display downsampled and upsampled images
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(8, 8))

# Plot the downsampled image
axes[0].imshow(im_dn, cmap='gray')
axes[0].set_title('Downsampled Image (64x64)')

# Plot the upsampled image
axes[1].imshow(im_up, cmap='gray')
axes[1].set_title('Upsampled Image (1024x1024)')

# Format and render the plot
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

- **Subplots**: This creates two vertically stacked subplots.
  - The first subplot displays the downsampled image.
  - The second subplot displays the upsampled image.
- **`imshow()`**: Displays each image in grayscale (`cmap='gray'`).
- **`tight_layout()`**: Adjusts the layout to prevent overlap between elements.

### Full Code:
```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.ndimage as ndi
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming 'im' is your 256x256 2D brain image slice

# Shift the image by (-20, -20) and rotate it by -35 degrees
xfm = ndi.shift(im, shift=(-20, -20))
xfm = ndi.rotate(xfm, angle=-35, reshape=False)

# Downsample the image to (64, 64)
im_dn = ndi.zoom(xfm, zoom=64/256)

# Upsample the image to (1024, 1024)
im_up = ndi.zoom(xfm, zoom=1024/256)

# Create subplots to display downsampled and upsampled images
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(8, 8))

# Plot the downsampled image
axes[0].imshow(im_dn, cmap='gray')
axes[0].set_title('Downsampled Image (64x64)')

# Plot the upsampled image
axes[1].imshow(im_up, cmap='gray')
axes[1].set_title('Upsampled Image (1024x1024)')

# Format and render the plot
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Conclusion:
- **Downsampling** reduces the image size by combining pixel data, making the image smaller and possibly losing some details.
- **Upsampling** increases the image size, which spreads pixel data over a larger area, and can result in a blurred image since pixel data is interpolated.
