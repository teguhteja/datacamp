# Identifying potential confounds

Identifying potential confounds
Once measures have been extracted, double-check for dependencies within your data. This is especially true if any image parameters (sampling rate, field of view) might differ between subjects, or you pull multiple measures from a single image.

For the final exercises, we have combined demographic and brain volume measures into a pandas DataFrame (df).

First, you will explore the table and available variables. Then, you will check for correlations between the data.

Print three random rows in df using the .sample() method.
# Print random sample of rows
print(____)

To print three random rows from a DataFrame using the `.sample()` method, you can specify the number of rows to sample with the `n` parameter.

Here is how you can do it:

```python
# Print random sample of 3 rows from the DataFrame
print(df.sample(n=3))
```

### Explanation:
- **`df.sample(n=3)`**: This selects 3 random rows from the DataFrame `df`.
- You can adjust the number of rows by changing the value of `n`.

This method will print 3 randomly selected rows from your DataFrame.

Print the unique number of individuals with Alzheimer's disease patients.

# Print random sample of rows
print(df.sample(3))

# Print prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease
print(____)


To print the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease using `value_counts()`, you would typically call this method on the `alzheimers` column. Here’s how you can modify your code to include that:

### Example Code:
```python
# Print random sample of rows
print(df.sample(3))

# Print prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease
print(df['alzheimers'].value_counts())
```

### Explanation:
- **`df.sample(3)`**: This line prints a random sample of 3 rows from the DataFrame.
- **`df['alzheimers'].value_counts()`**: This counts the occurrences of each unique value in the `alzheimers` column. It will show how many individuals are classified as `True` (having Alzheimer's) and `False` (not having Alzheimer's).

### Example Output:
The output of `value_counts()` would look something like this:
```
True     150
False    350
Name: alzheimers, dtype: int64
```

This indicates that there are 150 individuals with Alzheimer's disease and 350 without it, giving you the prevalence of the condition in the dataset.


Print the correlation table between each variable.
# Print random sample of rows
print(df.sample(3))

# Print prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease
print(df.alzheimers.value_counts())

# Print a correlation table
print(____)


To print the correlation table between each variable in your DataFrame, you can use the `.corr()` method. Here’s how to structure your code:

### Example Code:
```python
# Print random sample of rows
print(df.sample(3))

# Print prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease
print(df.alzheimers.value_counts())

# Print a correlation table
print(df.corr())
```

### Explanation:
- **`df.sample(3)`**: This line prints a random sample of 3 rows from the DataFrame.
- **`df.alzheimers.value_counts()`**: This counts how many individuals are classified as having or not having Alzheimer's disease.
- **`df.corr()`**: This computes the pairwise correlation of all numeric columns in the DataFrame, returning a correlation matrix that shows the relationship between each pair of variables.

### Example Output:
The output from `df.corr()` will look like a table with the correlation coefficients ranging from -1 to 1. For example:

```
                var1       var2       var3  ...
var1        1.000000  -0.345678   0.123456  ...
var2       -0.345678   1.000000  -0.234567  ...
var3        0.123456  -0.234567   1.000000  ...
...
```

This table indicates how strongly each pair of variables is correlated, with 1 indicating perfect positive correlation, -1 indicating perfect negative correlation, and 0 indicating no correlation.

    skull_vol   0.027       0.163      0.690      1.000


Based on the provided correlation table, here’s the interpretation for the potential answers related to the correlations between variables:

1. **"Torain vot, age = 0-16"**: This statement seems to be unclear and might contain typographical errors. It is difficult to assess its accuracy without further context. If it refers to a correlation range, it does not directly align with the correlation values shown in the table.

2. **"Torain vot, skutt vot = 0.69"**: This appears to suggest a correlation between `skull_vol` and `brain_vol`. Based on the correlation table:
   - The correlation between `skull_vol` and `brain_vol` is indeed **0.690**, indicating a strong positive correlation. This means that as the brain volume increases, the skull volume also tends to increase, and vice versa.

### Conclusion
From the options provided, the statement regarding **"skutt vot = 0.69"** is correct. It accurately reflects the correlation between `skull_vol` and `brain_vol` as shown in the correlation matrix. The other statement needs clarification or correction to properly interpret its meaning.
