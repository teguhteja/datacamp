# Rotations

Rotations
In cases where an object is angled or flipped, the image can be rotated. Using ndi.rotate(), the image is rotated from its center by the specified degrees from the right horizontal axis.

For this exercise, shift and rotate the brain image (im) so that it is roughly level and "facing" the right side of the image.

Instructions
100 XP
Shift im towards the center: 20 pixels left and 20 pixels up.
Use ndi.rotate to turn xfm 30 degrees downward. Set reshape=False to prevent the image shape from changing.
Plot the original and transformed images.

# Shift the image towards the center
xfm = ____

# Rotate the shifted image
xfm = ndi.rotate(____, angle=____, reshape=____)

# Plot the original and rotated images
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1)
axes[0].imshow(im)
