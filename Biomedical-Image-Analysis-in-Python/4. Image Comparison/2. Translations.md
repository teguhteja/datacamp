# Translations

Translations
In this chapter, we'll leverage data use data from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies to compare the brains of different populations: young and old, male and female, healthy and diseased.

To start, center a single slice of a 3D brain volume (im). First, find the center point in the image array and the center of mass of the brain. Then, translate the image to the center.

This chapter's exercises have all had the following imports:

import imageio
import numpy as np
import scipy.ndimage as ndi
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Find the center-point of im using ndi.center_of_mass().
Calculate the distance from the image center (128, 128), along each axis.
Use ndi.shift() to shift the data.

# Find image center of mass
com = ____

# Calculate amount of shift needed
d0 = 128 - _____
d1 = ____

# Translate the brain towards the center
xfm = ndi.shift(____, shift=____)

```py
# Find image center of mass
com = ndi.center_of_mass(im)

# Calculate amount of shift needed
d0 = 128 - com[0]
d1 = 128 - com[1]

# Translate the brain towards the center
xfm = ndi.shift(im, shift=(d0, d1))

```

Let's break down the code snippet to understand what each part does:

### 1. **Find the image center of mass**
```python
com = ndi.center_of_mass(im)
```
- **What it does**: This line uses the `ndi.center_of_mass()` function from the `scipy.ndimage` module to calculate the center of mass of the brain image stored in the `im` array.
- **How it works**: 
  - The `center_of_mass()` function treats the non-zero pixels in the image as having mass and calculates the weighted average of their positions. This gives the coordinates `(com[0], com[1])`, which represent the center point of the brain's mass in the image.
  - These values are floating-point numbers, with `com[0]` being the row (y-axis) and `com[1]` the column (x-axis).

### 2. **Calculate the amount of shift needed**
```python
d0 = 128 - com[0]
d1 = 128 - com[1]
```
- **What it does**: Here, we calculate how much the image needs to be shifted in both the row and column directions to move the brain’s center of mass to the image center.
- **How it works**:
  - The image center is assumed to be at the coordinates `(128, 128)` because the image dimensions are likely 256x256 pixels.
  - `d0 = 128 - com[0]`: This gives the shift needed in the row direction (up or down), i.e., how much we need to move the center of mass along the vertical axis to bring it to the middle of the image.
  - `d1 = 128 - com[1]`: This gives the shift needed in the column direction (left or right), i.e., how much we need to move along the horizontal axis.

### 3. **Translate the brain towards the center**
```python
xfm = ndi.shift(im, shift=(d0, d1))
```
- **What it does**: This line uses the `ndi.shift()` function to apply the calculated shifts to the brain image `im`, effectively translating (moving) the brain's center of mass to the center of the image.
- **How it works**:
  - `ndi.shift()` takes in the image `im` and a `shift` parameter, which is a tuple `(d0, d1)`. These values represent the shifts along the row and column directions, respectively.
  - The function adjusts the image by shifting all pixels accordingly. The image is shifted by `d0` rows (positive values move down, negative values move up) and by `d1` columns (positive values move right, negative values move left).
  - This results in `xfm`, the new image where the brain’s center of mass has been moved to the center of the image.

### Summary of the Code Flow:

1. **Find the brain's center**: Using `ndi.center_of_mass()`, you compute where the brain's center is located in the image.
2. **Calculate shift**: Subtract the current center from the desired center (128, 128) to figure out how far the brain needs to move.
3. **Apply shift**: Use `ndi.shift()` to move the entire brain image so that its center of mass aligns with the center of the image.

Plot the original and shifted data. First, create an array of subplots with two rows and one column. Then, draw im and xfm on the first and second subplots.

# Find image center of mass
com = ndi.center_of_mass(im)

# Calculate amount of shift needed
d0 = 128 - com[0]
d1 = 128 - com[1]

# Translate the brain towards the center
xfm = ndi.shift(im, shift=(d0, d1))

# Plot the original and adjusted images
fig, axes = ____
axes[0].imshow(im)
____
format_and_render_plot()


Here’s how you can complete the code to create the subplots, display both the original and shifted images, and format the plot properly:

### Full Code:

```python
import imageio
import numpy as np
import scipy.ndimage as ndi
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming 'im' is your 2D brain image slice or a specific 2D slice from a 3D volume

# Find the image center of mass
com = ndi.center_of_mass(im)

# Calculate amount of shift needed
d0 = 128 - com[0]
d1 = 128 - com[1]

# Translate the brain towards the center
xfm = ndi.shift(im, shift=(d0, d1))

# Create subplots (2 rows, 1 column)
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(8, 8))

# Plot the original image on the first subplot
axes[0].imshow(im, cmap='gray')
axes[0].set_title('Original Image')

# Plot the shifted image on the second subplot
axes[1].imshow(xfm, cmap='gray')
axes[1].set_title('Shifted Image')

# Formatting and rendering the plot
plt.tight_layout()  # Adjust layout to prevent overlap
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Create subplots**: 
   ```python
   fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(8, 8))
   ```
   This creates a figure with 2 subplots arranged in 2 rows and 1 column. The `figsize=(8, 8)` defines the size of the figure.

2. **Display the original image**: 
   ```python
   axes[0].imshow(im, cmap='gray')
   axes[0].set_title('Original Image')
   ```
   This draws the original image (`im`) on the first subplot (`axes[0]`) and adds a title for clarity.

3. **Display the shifted image**: 
   ```python
   axes[1].imshow(xfm, cmap='gray')
   axes[1].set_title('Shifted Image')
   ```
   This draws the translated image (`xfm`) on the second subplot (`axes[1]`) and adds a title.

4. **Render the plot**: 
   ```python
   plt.tight_layout()
   plt.show()
   ```
   `plt.tight_layout()` ensures that the layout is adjusted to prevent overlap between the plots, and `plt.show()` displays the final result. 

This will give you two images, one showing the original brain slice and the other showing the brain slice after the shift, displayed side by side.
