# Filter functions

Filter functions
Convolutions rely on a set of weights, but filtering can also be done using functions such as the mean, median and maximum. Just like with convolutions, filter functions will update each pixel value based on its local neighborhood.

Consider the following lines of code:

im = np.array([[93, 36,  87], 
               [18, 49,  51],
               [45, 32,  63]])

im_filt = ____

assert im_filt[1,1] == 49
Which of the following statements should go in the blank so that the assert statement evaluates to True?

Possible answers


ndi.maximum_filter(im, size=3)

ndi.uniform_filter(im, size=3)

ndi.percentile_filter(im, 60, size=3)

ndi.median_filter(im, size=3)

To ensure the assertion `assert im_filt[1, 1] == 49` evaluates to True, you want to choose a filtering method that will result in the central pixel (1, 1) being updated to the value 49 based on its local neighborhood.

Given the input image:

```plaintext
93  36  87
18  49  51
45  32  63
```

**Analyzing each option:**

1. **`ndi.maximum_filter(im, size=3)`**: This filter would take the maximum value from the 3x3 neighborhood, which would be 93. Hence, `im_filt[1, 1]` would not be 49.
  
2. **`ndi.uniform_filter(im, size=3)`**: This filter calculates the mean value from the neighborhood. The mean value would not be exactly 49 but instead approximately 52.33. Hence, `im_filt[1, 1]` would not be 49.

3. **`ndi.percentile_filter(im, 60, size=3)`**: This filter would return the 60th percentile of the pixel values in the 3x3 neighborhood. The values in the neighborhood are `[93, 36, 87, 18, 49, 51, 45, 32, 63]`. The 60th percentile would indeed be 49. Therefore, this option is a potential candidate.

4. **`ndi.median_filter(im, size=3)`**: This filter calculates the median value of the pixel values in the neighborhood. The sorted values are `[18, 32, 36, 45, 49, 51, 63, 87, 93]`, and the median would be 49. Hence, `im_filt[1, 1]` would equal 49.

**Conclusion:**
Both the **`ndi.percentile_filter(im, 60, size=3)`** and **`ndi.median_filter(im, size=3)`** options will make the assert statement evaluate to True.

However, since only one option is correct to fill in the blank, the **best choice** based on the problem context would be:

```python
im_filt = ndi.median_filter(im, size=3)
```

This choice effectively filters the image while also providing the expected result for the assertion.
