# Detect edges (1)

Detect edges (1)
Filters can also be used as "detectors." If a part of the image fits the weighting pattern, the returned value will be very high (or very low).

In the case of edge detection, that pattern is a change in intensity along a plane. A filter detecting horizontal edges might look like this:

weights = [[+1, +1, +1],
           [ 0,  0,  0],
           [-1, -1, -1]]
For this exercise, create a vertical edge detector and see how well it performs on the hand x-ray (im).

Instructions
100 XP
Create a 3x3 array of filter weights that detects when intensity changes from the left to right. Use only the values 1, 0 and -1.
Convolve im with the edge detector.
Plot the horizontal edges with the seismic colormap. Use vmin=-150 and vmax=150 to control adjust your colormap scale.
Add a colorbar and render the results.

# Set weights to detect vertical edges
weights = [[____], [____], [____]]

# Convolve "im" with filter weights
edges = ____

# Draw the image in color
plt.imshow(____, ____, vmin=-150, vmax=150)
____
format_and_render_plot()

To create a vertical edge detector and visualize its effect on the hand x-ray image (`im`), you'll need to fill in the blanks with the appropriate weights and function calls. Here's how you can do it:

### Code Snippet

```python
# Set weights to detect vertical edges
weights = [[+1, 0, -1],  # Detects change from left to right
           [+1, 0, -1], 
           [+1, 0, -1]]

# Convolve "im" with filter weights
edges = ndi.convolve(im, weights)

# Draw the image in color
plt.imshow(edges, cmap='seismic', vmin=-150, vmax=150)  # Use the seismic colormap with specified limits
plt.colorbar()  # Add a colorbar to show the intensity scale
format_and_render_plot()
```

### Explanation

1. **Setting Weights for Vertical Edge Detection:**
   - The filter weights for detecting vertical edges are defined as:
     ```python
     weights = [[+1, 0, -1],
                [+1, 0, -1], 
                [+1, 0, -1]]
     ```
   - This filter will respond strongly to vertical edges, where there's a change in intensity from the left side of the pixel to the right side.

2. **Convolution:**
   - `edges = ndi.convolve(im, weights)`: This line applies the vertical edge detector filter to the image `im`, producing an output array that highlights the edges.

3. **Visualizing the Edges:**
   - `plt.imshow(edges, cmap='seismic', vmin=-150, vmax=150)`: This displays the edge-detected image using the seismic colormap, adjusting the color scale with `vmin` and `vmax` to focus on the relevant intensity range.
   - `plt.colorbar()`: This adds a color bar to the plot, providing a reference for the intensity values.

4. **Rendering the Plot:**
   - Finally, `format_and_render_plot()` is called to render the subplot with the edge-detected image.

### Conclusion
This code will help you visualize the vertical edges in the hand x-ray image, allowing you to analyze the features present in the image based on intensity changes. Adjusting `vmin` and `vmax` will help enhance the visibility of the detected edges.
