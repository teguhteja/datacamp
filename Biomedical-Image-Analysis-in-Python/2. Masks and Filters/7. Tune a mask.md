# Tune a mask

Tune a mask
Imperfect masks can be tuned through the addition and subtraction of pixels. SciPy includes several useful methods for accomplishing these ends. These include:

binary_dilation: Add pixels along edges
binary_erosion: Remove pixels along edges
binary_opening: Erode then dilate, "opening" areas near edges
binary_closing: Dilate then erode, "filling in" holes
For this exercise, create a bone mask then tune it to include additional pixels.

For the remaining exercises, we have run the following import for you:

import scipy.ndimage as ndi
Instructions
100 XP
Create a bone by selecting pixels from im that are greater than or equal to 145.
Use ndi.binary_dilation() to increase the size of mask_bone. Set the number of iterations to 5 to perform the dilation multiple times.
Use ndi.binary_closing() to fill in holes in mask_bone. Set the number of iterations to 5 to holes up to 10 pixels wide.
Plot the original and tuned masks.

format_and_render_plot()


You're correct! The `ndi.binary_closing()` function performs dilation followed by erosion, which effectively closes small gaps or holes in the mask. Here's the proper explanation and how it works for the bone mask:

- **Create the bone mask** by selecting pixels in the image (`im`) that are greater than or equal to 145. This forms the initial binary mask where bones are represented as `True`.
- **Binary dilation** expands the boundaries of the mask by a certain number of pixels (5 in this case), making it larger.
- **Binary closing** then dilates and erodes, helping to "close" small holes or gaps within the mask up to 10 pixels wide (5 pixels dilation + 5 pixels erosion).

Hereâ€™s the full, corrected code for your case:

### Corrected Code Example

```python
# Create the bone mask by selecting pixels with intensity >= 145
mask_bone = im >= 145

# Apply binary dilation to expand the mask (5 iterations)
mask_dilate = ndi.binary_dilation(mask_bone, iterations=5)

# Apply binary closing to fill holes in the dilated mask (5 iterations)
mask_closed = ndi.binary_closing(mask_bone, iterations=5)

# Plot the original, dilated, and closed masks
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 5))

# Display original mask
axes[0].imshow(mask_bone, cmap='gray')
axes[0].set_title("Original Bone Mask")

# Display dilated mask
axes[1].imshow(mask_dilate, cmap='gray')
axes[1].set_title("Dilated Mask")

# Display closed mask (holes filled)
axes[2].imshow(mask_closed, cmap='gray')
axes[2].set_title("Closed Mask (Holes Filled)")

# Render the plot
format_and_render_plot()
```

### Breakdown:
- **mask_bone**: Creates the initial mask by selecting pixels where `im >= 145`.
- **mask_dilate**: Enlarges the mask by dilating it for 5 iterations.
- **mask_closed**: Closes small holes (up to 10 pixels wide) in the original `mask_bone` by applying `binary_closing`.
