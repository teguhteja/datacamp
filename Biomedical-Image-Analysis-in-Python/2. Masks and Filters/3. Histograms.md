# Histograms

Histograms
Histograms display the distribution of values in your image by binning each element by its intensity then measuring the size of each bin.

The area under a histogram is called the cumulative distribution function. It measures the frequency with which a given range of pixel intensities occurs.

For this exercise, describe the intensity distribution in im by calculating the histogram and cumulative distribution function and displaying them together.

Instructions

Import scipy.ndimage as ndi.
Generate a 256-bin histogram of im which covers the full range of np.uint8 values.
Calculate the cumulative distribution function for im. First, find the cumulative sum of hist, then divide by the total number of pixels in hist.
Plot hist and cdf on separate subplots. This has been done for you.

# Import SciPy's "ndimage" module
import ____ as ____ 

# Create a histogram, binned at each possible value
hist = ____

# Create a cumulative distribution function
cdf = hist.cumsum() / ____

# Plot the histogram and CDF
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1, sharex=True)
axes[0].plot(hist, label='Histogram')
axes[1].plot(cdf, label='CDF')
format_and_render_plot()

Hereâ€™s how you can calculate the histogram, cumulative distribution function (CDF), and plot both using the image data:

### Complete Code Example

```python
# Import necessary modules
import scipy.ndimage as ndi
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming the image 'im' is already loaded from the previous steps

# Create a histogram, binned at each possible value for np.uint8 (0-255)
hist, bin_edges = np.histogram(im, bins=256, range=(0, 255))

# Create a cumulative distribution function
cdf = hist.cumsum() / hist.sum()  # Normalize by the total number of pixels

# Plot the histogram and CDF
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1, sharex=True, figsize=(8, 6))

# Plot histogram
axes[0].plot(hist, label='Histogram', color='blue')
axes[0].set_ylabel('Pixel Count')
axes[0].legend()

# Plot CDF
axes[1].plot(cdf, label='CDF', color='green')
axes[1].set_ylabel('Cumulative Probability')
axes[1].legend()

# Render the plots (assuming format_and_render_plot is a custom function)
format_and_render_plot()
```

### Explanation of Key Steps:

1. **Calculating the Histogram**:
   - `np.histogram(im, bins=256, range=(0, 255))`: This calculates the histogram of the image with 256 bins, corresponding to each possible value for an 8-bit image (0-255). The `hist` variable holds the count of pixels for each intensity, and `bin_edges` holds the boundaries of the bins.

2. **Calculating the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**:
   - `hist.cumsum()`: Computes the cumulative sum of the histogram. This represents the cumulative distribution of pixel intensities.
   - `hist.sum()`: This is the total number of pixels in the image, used to normalize the CDF so that it ranges between 0 and 1.

3. **Plotting**:
   - `plt.subplots(2, 1, sharex=True)`: Creates two vertically stacked subplots that share the x-axis.
   - The first subplot plots the histogram, showing the distribution of pixel intensities.
   - The second subplot plots the CDF, showing the cumulative probability of pixel intensities.

### Summary:
This code visualizes the histogram and cumulative distribution of intensities in the image, helping you understand how pixel values are distributed and accumulated.
