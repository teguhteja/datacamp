# Smoothing

Smoothing
Smoothing can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of your image by blurring out small variations in intensity. The Gaussian filter is excellent for this: it is a circular (or spherical) smoothing kernel that weights nearby pixels higher than distant ones.

The width of the distribution is controlled by the sigma argument, with higher values leading to larger smoothing effects.

For this exercise, test the effects of applying Gaussian filters to the foot x-ray before creating a bone mask.

Convolve im with Gaussian filters of size sigma=1 and sigma=3.
Plot the "bone masks" of im, im_s1, and im_s3 (i.e., where intensities are greater than or equal to 145).

# Smooth "im" with Gaussian filters
im_s1 = ndi.gaussian_filter(____, sigma=____)
im_s3 = ____

# Draw bone masks of each image
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1,3)
axes[0].imshow(____ >= 145)
axes[1].imshow(____)

To apply Gaussian filters to the foot x-ray image and create bone masks, you need to fill in the blanks with the appropriate function calls and variables. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Code Snippet

```python
# Smooth "im" with Gaussian filters
im_s1 = ndi.gaussian_filter(im, sigma=1)  # Apply Gaussian filter with sigma=1
im_s3 = ndi.gaussian_filter(im, sigma=3)  # Apply Gaussian filter with sigma=3

# Draw bone masks of each image
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3)
axes[0].imshow(im >= 145, cmap='gray')  # Bone mask from original image
axes[1].imshow(im_s1 >= 145, cmap='gray')  # Bone mask from image smoothed with sigma=1
axes[2].imshow(im_s3 >= 145, cmap='gray')  # Bone mask from image smoothed with sigma=3
format_and_render_plot()
```

### Explanation

1. **Smoothing the Image:**
   - `im_s1 = ndi.gaussian_filter(im, sigma=1)`: This line applies a Gaussian filter with a standard deviation (`sigma`) of 1 to the original image `im`.
   - `im_s3 = ndi.gaussian_filter(im, sigma=3)`: This line applies a Gaussian filter with a standard deviation of 3, which will result in more smoothing compared to `sigma=1`.

2. **Creating Bone Masks:**
   - The masks are created by checking where the pixel intensities are greater than or equal to 145 in each image.
   - `axes[0].imshow(im >= 145, cmap='gray')`: This displays the bone mask from the original image.
   - `axes[1].imshow(im_s1 >= 145, cmap='gray')`: This displays the bone mask after applying the Gaussian filter with `sigma=1`.
   - `axes[2].imshow(im_s3 >= 145, cmap='gray')`: This displays the bone mask after applying the Gaussian filter with `sigma=3`.

3. **Rendering the Plot:**
   - Finally, `format_and_render_plot()` is called to render the subplots.

### Conclusion
This code will allow you to visualize the effects of smoothing on the bone masks from the original and filtered images. Higher `sigma` values will generally yield smoother images and potentially different bone mask results due to reduced noise.
