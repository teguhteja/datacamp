# Apply a mask

Apply a mask
Although masks are binary, they can be applied to images to filter out pixels where the mask is False.

NumPy's where() function is a flexible way of applying masks. It takes three arguments:

np.where(condition, x, y)
condition, x and y can be either arrays or single values. This allows you to pass through original image values while setting masked values to 0.

Let's practice applying masks by selecting the bone-like pixels from the hand x-ray (im).

Instructions

Create a Boolean bone mask by selecting pixels greater than or equal to 145.
Apply the mask to your image using np.where(). Values not in the mask should be set to 0.
Create a histogram of the masked image. Use the following arguments to select only non-zero pixels: min=1, max=255, bins=255.
Plot the masked image and the histogram. This has been done for you.

# Import SciPy's "ndimage" module
____

# Screen out non-bone pixels from "im"
mask_bone = ____
im_bone = np.where(____, ____, ____)

# Get the histogram of bone intensities
hist = ____

# Plot masked image and histogram
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2,1)
axes[0].imshow(im_bone)
axes[1].plot(hist)
format_and_render_plot()


Here’s how you can apply a mask to select bone-like pixels from the X-ray image and generate a histogram of the masked image:

### Complete Code Example

```python
# Import SciPy's "ndimage" module
import scipy.ndimage as ndi
import numpy as np

# Screen out non-bone pixels from "im"
mask_bone = im >= 145
im_bone = np.where(mask_bone, im, 0)

# Get the histogram of bone intensities (only non-zero pixels)
hist = ndi.histogram(im_bone, min=1, max=255, bins=255)

# Plot masked image and histogram
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(10, 6))

# Plot the masked image
axes[0].imshow(im_bone, cmap='gray')
axes[0].set_title("Bone Pixels from Hand X-ray")

# Plot the histogram of bone intensities
axes[1].plot(hist)
axes[1].set_title("Histogram of Bone Intensities")

# Render the plot (assuming format_and_render_plot is a custom function)
format_and_render_plot()
```

### Explanation of Key Steps:

1. **Create the Bone Mask**:
   - `mask_bone = im >= 145`: This Boolean mask selects pixels that represent bone-like structures in the X-ray, based on their intensity values.

2. **Apply the Mask**:
   - `im_bone = np.where(mask_bone, im, 0)`: This applies the bone mask to the image. Where `mask_bone` is `True`, the original image intensity values are retained. Where it’s `False`, the intensity is set to 0.

3. **Calculate the Histogram**:
   - `hist = ndi.histogram(im_bone, min=1, max=255, bins=255)`: This calculates the histogram of the masked image, excluding values of 0 (which represent non-bone areas).

4. **Plot the Masked Image and Histogram**:
   - The first plot visualizes the X-ray image with only bone-like structures visible.
   - The second plot shows the histogram of intensity values for the bone pixels.

5. **Rendering**:
   - `format_and_render_plot()`: This custom function is used to finalize the plot rendering.

### Summary:
This code filters out non-bone pixels from an X-ray image and visualizes both the bone-only image and its histogram of intensity values.
