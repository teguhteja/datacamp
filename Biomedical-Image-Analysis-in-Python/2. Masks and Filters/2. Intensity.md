# Intensity

Intensity
In this chapter, we will work with a hand radiograph from a 2017 Radiological Society of North America competition. X-ray absorption is highest in dense tissue such as bone, so the resulting intensities should be high. Consequently, images like this can be used to predict "bone age" in children.

To start, let's load the image and check its intensity range.

The image datatype determines the range of possible intensities: e.g., 8-bit unsigned integers (uint8) can take values in the range of 0 to 255. A colorbar can be helpful for connecting these values to the visualized image.

All exercises in this chapter have the following imports:

import imageio
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
Instructions

Load the image "hand-xray.jpg" using imageio.
Print the image's data type (dtype), minimum (min()) and maximum intensity (max()).
Plot the image using plt.imshow(). Explicitly set the colormap's minimum (0) and maximum (255) values using the vmin and vmax arguments.
Add a colorbar using plt.colorbar(), then render the plot using the custom function format_and_render_plot(). This has been done for you.

Hereâ€™s how you can load the image, check its properties, and display it with appropriate settings for grayscale:

### Complete Code Example

```python
# Import ImageIO and PyPlot
import imageio
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the hand radiograph
im = imageio.imread('hand-xray.jpg')
print('Data type:', im.dtype)
print('Min. value:', im.min())
print('Max value:', im.max())

# Plot the grayscale image
plt.imshow(im, cmap='gray', vmin=0, vmax=255)
plt.colorbar()

# Render the plot (custom function provided)
format_and_render_plot()
```

### Explanation of Key Steps:

1. **Loading the Image**:
   - `imageio.imread('hand-xray.jpg')`: Loads the image as a NumPy array, which stores pixel intensity values.

2. **Printing Image Properties**:
   - `im.dtype`: Prints the data type of the image, showing what format the pixel values are stored in (e.g., `uint8`, `float32`).
   - `im.min()`: Displays the minimum pixel intensity in the image.
   - `im.max()`: Shows the maximum pixel intensity in the image.

3. **Plotting the Image**:
   - `plt.imshow(im, cmap='gray', vmin=0, vmax=255)`: Displays the image with grayscale colormap and explicitly sets the pixel intensity range to be between 0 and 255 for contrast control.
   - `plt.colorbar()`: Adds a color bar to the side of the plot for reference.

4. **Rendering**:
   - `format_and_render_plot()`: This is a custom function (assumed to be provided) that formats and renders the plot.

This code will display the X-ray image with pixel intensities mapped between 0 (black) and 255 (white), and a color bar indicating the intensity range.
