# Filter convolutions

Filter convolutions
Filters are an essential tool in image processing. They allow you to transform images based on intensity values surrounding a pixel, rather than globally.

For this exercise, smooth the foot radiograph. First, specify the weights to be used. (These are called "footprints" and "kernels" as well.) Then, convolve the filter with im and plot the result.

Create a three by three array of filter weights. Set each element to 0.11 to perform mean filtering (also called "uniform filtering").

Create a three by three array of filter weights. Set each element to 0.11 to perform mean filtering (also called "uniform filtering").

# Set filter weights
weights = [[0.11, 0.11, ____],
           [0.11, ____, 0.11], 
           ____]


To create a 3x3 array of filter weights for mean filtering, you can set each element to 0.11 as follows:

### Complete Code

```python
# Set filter weights for 3x3 mean filtering
weights = [[0.11, 0.11, 0.11],
           [0.11, 0.11, 0.11], 
           [0.11, 0.11, 0.11]]
```

This creates a 3x3 matrix where each element is `0.11`, which corresponds to a mean filter. The sum of all the elements in the filter will be approximately `1`, ensuring that when it's applied, it averages the neighboring pixels evenly.

Convolve im with weights using ndi.convolve().

# Set filter weights
weights = [[0.11, 0.11, 0.11],
           [0.11, 0.11, 0.11], 
           [0.11, 0.11, 0.11]]

# Convolve the image with the filter
im_filt = ____

You can convolve the image `im` with the filter weights using `ndi.convolve()` as follows:

```python
import scipy.ndimage as ndi

# Set filter weights for 3x3 mean filtering
weights = [[0.11, 0.11, 0.11],
           [0.11, 0.11, 0.11], 
           [0.11, 0.11, 0.11]]

# Convolve the image with the filter
im_filt = ndi.convolve(im, weights)
```

This will apply the mean filter to the image `im`, producing a smoothed version of the image.

Plot the original and mean-filtered images.

# Set filter weights
weights = [[0.11, 0.11, 0.11],
           [0.11, 0.11, 0.11], 
           [0.11, 0.11, 0.11]]

# Convolve the image with the filter
im_filt = ndi.convolve(im, weights)

# Plot the images
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1,2)
axes[0].imshow(im)
____
format_and_render_plot()

You're right! To include the `format_and_render_plot()` function after plotting the images, here's the revised code:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scipy.ndimage as ndi

# Set filter weights for 3x3 mean filtering
weights = [[0.11, 0.11, 0.11],
           [0.11, 0.11, 0.11], 
           [0.11, 0.11, 0.11]]

# Convolve the image with the filter
im_filt = ndi.convolve(im, weights)

# Plot the original and filtered images
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2)
axes[0].imshow(im, cmap='gray')
axes[0].set_title('Original Image')
axes[1].imshow(im_filt, cmap='gray')
axes[1].set_title('Mean Filtered Image')

# Remove ticks and render the plots
for ax in axes:
    ax.axis('off')

# Call the custom rendering function
format_and_render_plot()
```

This will ensure that the plot is formatted and displayed properly with the specified function.
