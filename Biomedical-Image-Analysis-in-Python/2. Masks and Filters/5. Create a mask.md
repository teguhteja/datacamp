# Create a mask

Create a mask
Masks are the primary method for removing or selecting specific parts of an image. They are binary arrays that indicate whether a value should be included in an analysis. Typically, masks are created by applying one or more logical operations to an image.

For this exercise, try to use a simple intensity threshold to differentiate between skin and bone in the hand radiograph. (im has been equalized to utilize the whole intensity range.)

Below is the histogram of im colored by the segments we will plot.

Create a bone mask by selecting pixels with intensities greater than or equal to 145.
Create a skin mask by selecting pixels with intensities greater than or equal to 45 and less than 145.
Plot the skin and bone masks in grayscale.

Hereâ€™s how you can create the bone and skin masks based on pixel intensity thresholds and plot them in grayscale:

### Complete Code Example

```python
# Create skin and bone masks
mask_bone = im >= 145
mask_skin = (im >= 45) & (im < 145)

# Plot the skin (left) and bone (right) masks
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 5))

# Plot skin mask
axes[0].imshow(mask_skin, cmap='gray')
axes[0].set_title("Skin Mask")

# Plot bone mask
axes[1].imshow(mask_bone, cmap='gray')
axes[1].set_title("Bone Mask")

# Render the plot (assuming format_and_render_plot is a custom function)
format_and_render_plot()
```

### Explanation of Key Steps:

1. **Creating the Bone Mask**:
   - `mask_bone = im >= 145`: Selects pixels with intensities greater than or equal to 145. These are likely to represent bone in an X-ray image.

2. **Creating the Skin Mask**:
   - `mask_skin = (im >= 45) & (im < 145)`: Selects pixels with intensities between 45 and 145. These values likely correspond to skin or softer tissues in the image.

3. **Plotting the Masks**:
   - `plt.subplots(1, 2)`: Creates two side-by-side subplots for visualizing the skin and bone masks.
   - `imshow(mask_skin, cmap='gray')`: Plots the skin mask with grayscale coloring.
   - `imshow(mask_bone, cmap='gray')`: Plots the bone mask with grayscale coloring.

4. **Rendering**:
   - `format_and_render_plot()`: This is a custom function assumed to handle the final display of the plots.

### Summary:
This code generates binary masks that distinguish bone and skin based on intensity ranges. It visualizes the selected regions to help differentiate between tissues in the image.
