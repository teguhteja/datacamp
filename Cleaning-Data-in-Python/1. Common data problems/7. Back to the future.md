# Back to the future

Back to the future
A new update to the data pipeline feeding into the ride_sharing DataFrame has been updated to register each ride's date. This information is stored in the ride_date column of the type object, which represents strings in pandas.

A bug was discovered which was relaying rides taken today as taken next year. To fix this, you will find all instances of the ride_date column that occur anytime in the future, and set the maximum possible value of this column to today's date. Before doing so, you would need to convert ride_date to a datetime object.

The datetime package has been imported as dt, alongside all the packages you've been using till now.

Convert ride_date to a datetime object using to_datetime(), then convert the datetime object into a date and store it in ride_dt column.
Create the variable today, which stores today's date by using the dt.date.today() function.
For all instances of ride_dt in the future, set them to today's date.
Print the maximum date in the ride_dt column.

# Convert ride_date to date
ride_sharing['ride_dt'] = pd.____(____['____']).dt.date

# Save today's date
today = ____

# Set all in the future to today's date
ride_sharing.____[____['____'] > ____, '____'] = ____

# Print maximum of ride_dt column
print(ride_sharing['ride_dt'].____())


Here's how to implement the solution according to the instructions:

```python
# Convert ride_date to date
ride_sharing['ride_dt'] = pd.to_datetime(ride_sharing['ride_date']).dt.date

# Save today's date
today = dt.date.today()

# Set all dates in the future to today's date
ride_sharing.loc[ride_sharing['ride_dt'] > today, 'ride_dt'] = today

# Print maximum of ride_dt column
print(ride_sharing['ride_dt'].max())
```

### Explanation

1. **Convert `ride_date` to a Date**  
   ```python
   ride_sharing['ride_dt'] = pd.to_datetime(ride_sharing['ride_date']).dt.date
   ```
   - This converts the `ride_date` column from string (object) type to datetime and then extracts the date part, storing it in `ride_dt`.

2. **Save Today’s Date**  
   ```python
   today = dt.date.today()
   ```
   - Using the `datetime` library, `dt.date.today()` captures today’s date, which we’ll use to replace any future dates in `ride_dt`.

3. **Set Future Dates to Today’s Date**  
   ```python
   ride_sharing.loc[ride_sharing['ride_dt'] > today, 'ride_dt'] = today
   ```
   - This line identifies rows where `ride_dt` is in the future and sets those dates to today’s date.

4. **Print the Maximum Date in `ride_dt`**  
   ```python
   print(ride_sharing['ride_dt'].max())
   ```
   - Finally, this line displays the maximum date in `ride_dt`, which should now be no later than today.
