# How big is your subset?

How big is your subset?
You have the following loans DataFrame which contains loan and credit score data for consumers, and some metadata such as their first and last names. You want to find both complete and incomplete duplicates using .duplicated().

first_name	last_name	credit_score	has_loan

loans.duplicated()
  Because the default method returns both complete and incomplete duplicates.
Press
1

loans.duplicated(subset = 'first_name')
  Because constraining the duplicate rows to the first name lets me find incomplete duplicates as well.
Press
2

loans.duplicated(subset = ['first_name', 'last_name'], keep = False)
  Because subsetting on consumer metadata and not discarding any duplicate returns all duplicated rows.
Press
3

loans.duplicated(subset = ['first_name', 'last_name'], keep = 'first')
  Because this drops all duplicates.

The correct answer is:

**Press 3**: 
```python
loans.duplicated(subset = ['first_name', 'last_name'], keep = False)
```
**Explanation:**
- This option subsets the DataFrame to check for duplicates based on both `first_name` and `last_name`, ensuring that it identifies complete duplicates (rows that are identical in both specified columns).
- The parameter `keep=False` means that all instances of the duplicates will be marked as `True`, allowing you to see all rows that have duplicates, rather than just the first occurrence. This is useful for finding all duplicated rows in the dataset. 

The other options have limitations:
1. **Press 1** would return a boolean Series indicating complete duplicates, but it doesn't allow for a nuanced look at specific columns.
2. **Press 2** would only check for duplicates in the `first_name` column, which is insufficient for identifying complete duplicates.
4. **Press 4** would keep only the first occurrence of each duplicate, which is not useful if you want to see all instances.
