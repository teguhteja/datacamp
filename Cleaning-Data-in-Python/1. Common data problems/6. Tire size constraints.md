# Tire size constraints

Tire size constraints
In this lesson, you're going to build on top of the work you've been doing with the ride_sharing DataFrame. You'll be working with the tire_sizes column which contains data on each bike's tire size.

Bicycle tire sizes could be either 26″, 27″ or 29″ and are here correctly stored as a categorical value. In an effort to cut maintenance costs, the ride sharing provider decided to set the maximum tire size to be 27″.

In this exercise, you will make sure the tire_sizes column has the correct range by first converting it to an integer, then setting and testing the new upper limit of 27″ for tire sizes.

Instructions
100 XP
Convert the tire_sizes column from category to 'int'.
Use .loc[] to set all values of tire_sizes above 27 to 27.
Reconvert back tire_sizes to 'category' from int.
Print the description of the tire_sizes.

# Convert tire_sizes to integer
ride_sharing['tire_sizes'] = ____['____'].____('____')

# Set all values above 27 to 27
ride_sharing.____[____ > ____, ____] = ____

# Reconvert tire_sizes back to categorical
ride_sharing['tire_sizes'] = ____

# Print tire size description
print(ride_sharing['tire_sizes'].____())


Here's how you can implement the code based on the instructions:

```python
# Convert tire_sizes to integer
ride_sharing['tire_sizes'] = ride_sharing['tire_sizes'].astype('int')

# Set all values above 27 to 27
ride_sharing.loc[ride_sharing['tire_sizes'] > 27, 'tire_sizes'] = 27

# Reconvert tire_sizes back to categorical
ride_sharing['tire_sizes'] = ride_sharing['tire_sizes'].astype('category')

# Print tire size description
print(ride_sharing['tire_sizes'].describe())
```

### Explanation

1. **Convert `tire_sizes` to Integer**  
   ```python
   ride_sharing['tire_sizes'] = ride_sharing['tire_sizes'].astype('int')
   ```
   - Here, the `tire_sizes` column is initially a categorical variable and needs to be converted to integer data type so that we can apply numerical operations (like setting a maximum limit).

2. **Set the Upper Limit to 27**  
   ```python
   ride_sharing.loc[ride_sharing['tire_sizes'] > 27, 'tire_sizes'] = 27
   ```
   - This line uses `.loc[]` to identify and set any values above 27 in the `tire_sizes` column to 27.
   - `.loc[]` is useful here because it allows us to apply the condition and the assignment to specific rows and columns.

3. **Reconvert `tire_sizes` Back to Categorical**  
   ```python
   ride_sharing['tire_sizes'] = ride_sharing['tire_sizes'].astype('category')
   ```
   - After setting the upper limit, we reconvert the `tire_sizes` column back to a categorical variable for consistent data handling and reduced memory usage.

4. **Print Description**  
   ```python
   print(ride_sharing['tire_sizes'].describe())
   ```
   - Finally, this line prints the summary description of `tire_sizes`, which should now show that no values exceed 27.
