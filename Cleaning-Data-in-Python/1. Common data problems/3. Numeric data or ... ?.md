# Numeric data or ... ?

Numeric data or ... ?
In this exercise, and throughout this chapter, you'll be working with bicycle ride sharing data in San Francisco called ride_sharing. It contains information on the start and end stations, the trip duration, and some user information for a bike sharing service.

The user_type column contains information on whether a user is taking a free ride and takes on the following values:

1 for free riders.
2 for pay per ride.
3 for monthly subscribers.
In this instance, you will print the information of ride_sharing using .info() and see a firsthand example of how an incorrect data type can flaw your analysis of the dataset. The pandas package is imported as pd.

Use .describe() to print the summary statistics of the user_type column from ride_sharing.

# Print the information of ride_sharing
print(____.____())

# Print summary statistics of user_type column
print(ride_sharing['____'].____())

To work with the `ride_sharing` dataset and examine the `user_type` column, you'll follow these steps:

### Instructions

1. **Print the Information of `ride_sharing`**:
   - Use `.info()` to check the structure and data types of the columns.

2. **Print Summary Statistics for `user_type`**:
   - Use `.describe()` to get summary statistics specifically for the `user_type` column.

### Code Solution

Here's the code you’ll need to complete this exercise:

```python
# Print the information of ride_sharing
print(ride_sharing.info())

# Print summary statistics of user_type column
print(ride_sharing['user_type'].describe())
```

### Explanation of Each Line

1. `ride_sharing.info()`:
   - This prints out the structure of the DataFrame, showing each column name, data type, and the number of non-null values, which can help you identify any data type issues.

2. `ride_sharing['user_type'].describe()`:
   - This gives you summary statistics for the `user_type` column, such as count, unique values, and frequency, which is useful to verify if the values match expectations for the column data type (numeric vs. categorical).

This code will help you identify whether `user_type` is treated as numeric or categorical, ensuring that any necessary adjustments to data types can be made to analyze the dataset accurately.

Question
By looking at the summary statistics - they don't really seem to offer much description on how users are distributed along their purchase type, why do you think that is?

Possible answers


The user_type column is not of the correct type, it should be converted to str.

The user_type column has an infinite set of possible values, it should be converted to category.

The user_type column has an finite set of possible values that represent groupings of data, it should be converted to category.



The correct answer is:

**"The user_type column has a finite set of possible values that represent groupings of data, it should be converted to category."**

### Explanation
The `user_type` column has a limited set of values (1, 2, 3), which categorize users into distinct groups (e.g., free riders, pay-per-ride, and monthly subscribers). Treating this column as a categorical data type is more suitable because it represents discrete groups rather than continuous numeric data. Converting `user_type` to a category will provide more meaningful summary statistics, such as counts for each category, rather than numeric summaries (mean, std, etc.) that don’t add value for this type of data.

Convert user_type into categorical by assigning it the 'category' data type and store it in the user_type_cat column.
Make sure you converted user_type_cat correctly by using an assert statement.

# Print the information of ride_sharing
print(ride_sharing.info())

# Print summary statistics of user_type column
print(ride_sharing['user_type'].describe())

# Convert user_type from integer to category
ride_sharing['user_type_cat'] = ride_sharing['user_type'].____

# Write an assert statement confirming the change
assert ride_sharing['user_type_cat'].____ == '____'

# Print new summary statistics 
print(ride_sharing['user_type_cat'].describe())

To complete the conversion of `user_type` to a categorical data type and confirm the conversion, use the following code with the appropriate methods filled in:

```python
# Print the information of ride_sharing
print(ride_sharing.info())

# Print summary statistics of user_type column
print(ride_sharing['user_type'].describe())

# Convert user_type from integer to category
ride_sharing['user_type_cat'] = ride_sharing['user_type'].astype('category')

# Write an assert statement confirming the change
assert ride_sharing['user_type_cat'].dtype == 'category'

# Print new summary statistics 
print(ride_sharing['user_type_cat'].describe())
```

### Explanation

- **`astype('category')`**: Converts `user_type` to the categorical type, storing it in `user_type_cat`.
- **`assert ride_sharing['user_type_cat'].dtype == 'category'`**: Verifies that `user_type_cat` is now of the categorical type.
- **`describe()`**: Provides a summary of each category's counts rather than summary statistics for numeric data.
