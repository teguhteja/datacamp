# Summing strings and concatenating numbers

Summing strings and concatenating numbers
In the previous exercise, you were able to identify that category is the correct data type for user_type and convert it in order to extract relevant statistical summaries that shed light on the distribution of user_type.

Another common data type problem is importing what should be numerical values as strings, as mathematical operations such as summing and multiplication lead to string concatenation, not numerical outputs.

In this exercise, you'll be converting the string column duration to the type int. Before that however, you will need to make sure to strip "minutes" from the column in order to make sure pandas reads it as numerical. The pandas package has been imported as pd.

Use the .strip() method to strip duration of "minutes" and store it in the duration_trim column.
Convert duration_trim to int and store it in the duration_time column.
Write an assert statement that checks if duration_time's data type is now an int.
Print the average ride duration.

# Strip duration of minutes
ride_sharing['duration_trim'] = ride_sharing['duration'].____.____()

# Convert duration to integer
ride_sharing['duration_time'] = ____

# Write an assert statement making sure of conversion
assert ride_sharing['____'].____ == '____'

# Print formed columns and calculate average ride duration 
print(ride_sharing[['duration','duration_trim','duration_time']])
print(____)

```py
# Strip duration of minutes
ride_sharing['duration_trim'] = ride_sharing['duration'].str.strip('minutes') 

# Convert duration to integer
ride_sharing['duration_time'] = ride_sharing['duration_trim'].astype('int')

# Write an assert statement making sure of conversion
assert ride_sharing['duration_time'].dtype == 'int'

# Print formed columns and calculate average ride duration 
print(ride_sharing[['duration','duration_trim','duration_time']])
print(ride_sharing['duration_time'].mean())


```

Here's an explanation of each line in this code snippet:

1. **Strip "minutes" from the `duration` column**  
   ```python
   ride_sharing['duration_trim'] = ride_sharing['duration'].str.strip('minutes') 
   ```
   - This line takes the `duration` column, which contains strings (like `"45 minutes"`), and removes the word `"minutes"` from each entry. 
   - `.str.strip('minutes')` specifically removes any occurrences of the substring `"minutes"` from the strings in the `duration` column, leaving only the numeric portion (e.g., `"45"`).
   - The result is stored in a new column called `duration_trim`.

2. **Convert `duration_trim` to integer**  
   ```python
   ride_sharing['duration_time'] = ride_sharing['duration_trim'].astype('int')
   ```
   - Here, the `duration_trim` column, which now contains only numbers in string format (e.g., `"45"`), is converted to an integer type using `.astype('int')`.
   - The result is saved in another new column, `duration_time`, so it can be used for numerical calculations.

3. **Assert that `duration_time` is now an integer**  
   ```python
   assert ride_sharing['duration_time'].dtype == 'int'
   ```
   - This line uses an `assert` statement to confirm that `duration_time` is of data type `int`. 
   - If `duration_time` is not an integer type, this line will raise an error, alerting you to the incorrect data type.

4. **Print and Calculate Average Ride Duration**  
   ```python
   print(ride_sharing[['duration','duration_trim','duration_time']])
   print(ride_sharing['duration_time'].mean())
   ```
   - The first `print()` displays the original `duration` column, along with the transformed `duration_trim` and `duration_time` columns, allowing you to visually verify that the transformation was successful.
   - The second `print()` calculates and prints the average ride duration using `.mean()` on the `duration_time` column. This line works correctly because `duration_time` has been converted to integers, enabling mathematical operations.
