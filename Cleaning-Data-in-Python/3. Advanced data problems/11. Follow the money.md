In this exercise, you're working with another version of the banking DataFrame that contains missing values for both the cust_id column and the acct_amount column.

You want to produce analysis on how many unique customers the bank has, the average amount held by customers and more. You know that rows with missing cust_id don't really help you, and that on average acct_amount is usually 5 times the amount of inv_amount.

In this exercise, you will drop rows of banking with missing cust_ids, and impute missing values of acct_amount with some domain knowledge.

Use .dropna() to drop missing values of the cust_id column in banking and store the results in banking_fullid.
Use inv_amount to compute the estimated account amounts for banking_fullid by setting the amounts equal to inv_amount * 5, and assign the results to acct_imp.
Impute the missing values of acct_amount in banking_fullid with the newly created acct_imp using .fillna().

# Drop missing values of cust_id
banking_fullid = banking.____(subset = ['____'])

# Compute estimated acct_amount
acct_imp = ____

# Impute missing acct_amount with corresponding acct_imp
banking_imputed = banking_fullid.____({'____':____})

# Print number of missing values
print(banking_imputed.isna().sum())


To complete the task of cleaning the `banking` DataFrame by dropping rows with missing `cust_id` values and imputing missing `acct_amount` values using the `inv_amount`, you can fill in the blanks as follows:

```python
# Drop missing values of cust_id
banking_fullid = banking.dropna(subset=['cust_id'])

# Compute estimated acct_amount
acct_imp = banking_fullid['inv_amount'] * 5

# Impute missing acct_amount with corresponding acct_imp
banking_imputed = banking_fullid.fillna({'acct_amount': acct_imp})

# Print number of missing values
print(banking_imputed.isna().sum())
```

### Explanation:

- **`banking.dropna(subset=['cust_id'])`**: This line removes rows from the `banking` DataFrame where the `cust_id` column has missing values. The result is stored in `banking_fullid`.

- **`acct_imp = banking_fullid['inv_amount'] * 5`**: This line calculates the estimated account amounts by multiplying the `inv_amount` by 5, based on the domain knowledge provided. The result is stored in `acct_imp`.

- **`banking_fullid.fillna({'acct_amount': acct_imp})`**: This line fills the missing values in the `acct_amount` column of `banking_fullid` with the corresponding values from `acct_imp`. The result is stored in `banking_imputed`.

- **`print(banking_imputed.isna().sum())`**: This line prints the number of missing values in each column of the `banking_imputed` DataFrame, allowing you to verify that the missing values have been handled appropriately.
