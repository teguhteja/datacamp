# Missing investors

Missing investors
Dealing with missing data is one of the most common tasks in data science. There are a variety of types of missingness, as well as a variety of types of solutions to missing data.

You just received a new version of the banking DataFrame containing data on the amount held and invested for new and existing customers. However, there are rows with missing inv_amount values.

You know for a fact that most customers below 25 do not have investment accounts yet, and suspect it could be driving the missingness. The pandas, missingno and matplotlib.pyplot packages have been imported as pd, msno and plt respectively. The banking DataFrame is in your environment.

Print the number of missing values by column in the banking DataFrame.
Plot and show the missingness matrix of banking with the msno.matrix() function.

# Print number of missing values in banking
print(____)

# Visualize missingness matrix
____
____

Certainly! To print the number of missing values by column in the `banking` DataFrame and visualize the missingness matrix using the `msno.matrix()` function, you can use the following code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import missingno as msno
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming 'banking' is your DataFrame

# Print number of missing values in banking
print(banking.isna().sum())

# Visualize missingness matrix
msno.matrix(banking)
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:

- **`banking.isna().sum()`**: This line calculates the number of missing values in each column of the `banking` DataFrame. `isna()` returns a DataFrame of the same shape as `banking`, with `True` for missing values and `False` for non-missing values. `sum()` then adds up the `True` values (which are treated as 1) for each column, giving the total number of missing values per column.

- **`msno.matrix(banking)`**: This function from the `missingno` library creates a visualization of the missing data in the DataFrame. It shows a matrix where each column represents a feature, and each row represents an observation. Missing values are shown as white lines.

- **`plt.show()`**: This line is used to display the plot. It ensures that the plot is rendered and visible in your output.

Before running this code, ensure that the `missingno` library is installed in your environment. You can install it using pip if necessary:

```bash
pip install missingno
```

This code will help you identify and visualize the missing data in your DataFrame, making it easier to understand the extent and pattern of missingness.

Isolate the values of banking missing values of inv_amount into missing_investors and with non-missing inv_amount values into investors.

# Print number of missing values in banking
print(banking.isna().sum())

# Visualize missingness matrix
msno.matrix(banking)
plt.show()

# Isolate missing and non missing values of inv_amount
missing_investors = ____
investors = ____

To isolate the rows with missing and non-missing values in the `inv_amount` column of the `banking` DataFrame, you can use boolean indexing. Here's how you can complete the code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import missingno as msno
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming 'banking' is your DataFrame

# Print number of missing values in banking
print(banking.isna().sum())

# Visualize missingness matrix
msno.matrix(banking)
plt.show()

# Isolate missing and non-missing values of inv_amount
missing_investors = banking[banking['inv_amount'].isna()]
investors = banking[banking['inv_amount'].notna()]
```

### Explanation:

- **`banking['inv_amount'].isna()`**: This creates a boolean Series where `True` indicates that the `inv_amount` value is missing (i.e., `NaN`) for that row.

- **`banking['inv_amount'].notna()`**: This creates a boolean Series where `True` indicates that the `inv_amount` value is not missing for that row.

- **`missing_investors`**: This variable stores the subset of the `banking` DataFrame where `inv_amount` is missing. It uses the boolean indexing with `isna()`.

- **`investors`**: This variable stores the subset of the `banking` DataFrame where `inv_amount` is not missing. It uses the boolean indexing with `notna()`.

This approach allows you to separate the data into two groups: those with missing investment amounts and those with recorded investment amounts.

Question
Now that you've isolated banking into investors and missing_investors, use the .describe() method on both of these DataFrames to understand whether there are structural differences between them. What do you think is going on?

Possible answers


The data is missing completely at random and there are no drivers behind the missingness.

The inv_amount is missing only for young customers, since the average age in missing_investors is 22 and the maximum age is 25.

The inv_amount is missing only for old customers, since the average age in missing_investors is 42 and the maximum age is 59.

To determine the structural differences between the `investors` and `missing_investors` DataFrames, you can use the `.describe()` method to get summary statistics for each. This will help you understand the distribution of ages and other relevant features in both groups. Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Describe the investors DataFrame
print("Investors DataFrame Description:")
print(investors.describe())

# Describe the missing_investors DataFrame
print("\nMissing Investors DataFrame Description:")
print(missing_investors.describe())
```

### Analysis

After running the above code, you should focus on the `age` column in the output of the `missing_investors.describe()` method. This will provide you with the mean, min, max, and other statistics for the age of customers with missing `inv_amount` values.

Based on the possible answers provided:

1. **The data is missing completely at random and there are no drivers behind the missingness.**
   - This would be the case if there are no noticeable differences in the age or other characteristics between the `investors` and `missing_investors` groups.

2. **The inv_amount is missing only for young customers, since the average age in missing_investors is 22 and the maximum age is 25.**
   - Choose this if the `describe()` output for `missing_investors` shows an average age around 22 and a maximum age of 25.

3. **The inv_amount is missing only for old customers, since the average age in missing_investors is 42 and the maximum age is 59.**
   - Choose this if the `describe()` output for `missing_investors` shows an average age around 42 and a maximum age of 59.

### Conclusion

Based on the statistics you observe, you can select the appropriate answer. If the `missing_investors` group has a significantly different age distribution compared to the `investors` group, it suggests that the missingness is not random and is related to age. If the age distribution is similar, the missingness might be random.


Based on the summary statistics provided for both the `investors` and `missing_investors` DataFrames, we can analyze the differences and determine the likely reason for the missing `inv_amount` values:

- **Investors DataFrame**:
  - The average age is approximately 43.56 years, with a minimum age of 26 and a maximum age of 59.

- **Missing Investors DataFrame**:
  - The average age is approximately 21.85 years, with a minimum age of 20 and a maximum age of 25.

### Conclusion

The `inv_amount` is missing primarily for younger customers, as indicated by the significantly lower average age and the age range (20 to 25) in the `missing_investors` DataFrame compared to the `investors` DataFrame.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**The inv_amount is missing only for young customers, since the average age in missing_investors is 22 and the maximum age is 25.**

Sort the banking DataFrame by the age column and plot the missingness matrix of banking_sorted.

# Print number of missing values in banking
print(banking.isna().sum())

# Visualize missingness matrix
msno.matrix(banking)
plt.show()

# Isolate missing and non missing values of inv_amount
missing_investors = banking[banking['inv_amount'].isna()]
investors = banking[~banking['inv_amount'].isna()]

# Sort banking by age and visualize
banking_sorted = ____
____
plt.show()

To sort the `banking` DataFrame by the `age` column and then plot the missingness matrix of the sorted DataFrame, you can complete the code as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd
import missingno as msno
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming 'banking' is your DataFrame

# Print number of missing values in banking
print(banking.isna().sum())

# Visualize missingness matrix
msno.matrix(banking)
plt.show()

# Isolate missing and non-missing values of inv_amount
missing_investors = banking[banking['inv_amount'].isna()]
investors = banking[~banking['inv_amount'].isna()]

# Sort banking by age and visualize
banking_sorted = banking.sort_values(by='age')
msno.matrix(banking_sorted)
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:

- **`banking.sort_values(by='age')`**: This line sorts the `banking` DataFrame by the `age` column in ascending order. The result is stored in `banking_sorted`.

- **`msno.matrix(banking_sorted)`**: This function is used again to visualize the missing data in the sorted DataFrame. Sorting by age can help reveal patterns in missingness related to age.

- **`plt.show()`**: This line ensures that the plot is displayed.

By sorting the DataFrame by age before visualizing the missingness matrix, you can better observe any patterns or trends in the missing data that might be related to age.
