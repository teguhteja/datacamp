Is this missing at random?
You've seen in the video exercise how there are a variety of missingness types when observing missing data. As a reminder, missingness types can be described as the following:

Missing Completely at Random: No systematic relationship between a column's missing values and other or own values.
Missing at Random: There is a systematic relationship between a column's missing values and other observed values.
Missing not at Random: There is a systematic relationship between a column's missing values and unobserved values.
You have a DataFrame containing customer satisfaction scores for a service. What type of missingness is the following?

                              A customer satisfaction_score column with missing values for highly dissatisfied customers.

The scenario described is one where the missing values in the `satisfaction_score` column are specifically for highly dissatisfied customers. This indicates that there is a systematic relationship between the missing values and the unobserved values (i.e., the dissatisfaction level of the customers, which is not directly observed in the data).

Therefore, the correct type of missingness in this case is:

**Missing not at random.**
