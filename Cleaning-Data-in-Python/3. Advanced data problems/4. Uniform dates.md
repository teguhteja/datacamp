# Uniform dates

Uniform dates
After having unified the currencies of your different account amounts, you want to add a temporal dimension to your analysis and see how customers have been investing their money given the size of their account over each year. The account_opened column represents when customers opened their accounts and is a good proxy for segmenting customer activity and investment over time.

However, since this data was consolidated from multiple sources, you need to make sure that all dates are of the same format. You will do so by converting this column into a datetime object, while making sure that the format is inferred and potentially incorrect formats are set to missing. The banking DataFrame is in your environment and pandas was imported as pd.

Print the header of account_opened from the banking DataFrame and take a look at the different results.

To print the header of the `account_opened` column from the `banking` DataFrame, you can use the `head()` method in pandas. Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Print the header of account_opened
print(banking['account_opened'].head())
```

This will display the first few entries of the `account_opened` column, allowing you to inspect the different date formats present in the data.

Question
Take a look at the output. You tried converting the values to datetime using the default to_datetime() function without changing any argument, however received the following error:

ValueError: month must be in 1..12
Why do you think that is?

Possible answers


The to_datetime() function needs to be explicitly told which date format each row is in.

The to_datetime() function can only be applied on YY-mm-dd date formats.

The 21-14-17 entry is erroneous and leads to an error.

The error message `ValueError: month must be in 1..12` suggests that there is an issue with the date format in one or more entries. The most likely reason for this error is:

- **The 21-14-17 entry is erroneous and leads to an error.**

This is because the date format `21-14-17` implies that the month value is `14`, which is not valid since months must be between `1` and `12`. This kind of error typically occurs when the day and month are swapped or when the data is incorrectly formatted. The `to_datetime()` function is capable of inferring various date formats, but it cannot handle invalid month values.

Convert the account_opened column to datetime, while making sure the date format is inferred and that erroneous formats that raise error return a missing value.

# Print the header of account_opened
print(banking['account_opened'].head())

# Convert account_opened to datetime
banking['account_opened'] = pd.to_datetime(____,
                                           # Infer datetime format
                                           infer_datetime_format = ____,
                                           # Return missing value for error
                                           errors = ____) 

To convert the `account_opened` column to datetime while ensuring that the date format is inferred and erroneous formats return a missing value, you can use the `pd.to_datetime()` function with the appropriate parameters. Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Print the header of account_opened
print(banking['account_opened'].head())

# Convert account_opened to datetime
banking['account_opened'] = pd.to_datetime(banking['account_opened'],
                                           # Infer datetime format
                                           infer_datetime_format=True,
                                           # Return missing value for error
                                           errors='coerce')
```

In this code:
- `infer_datetime_format=True` allows pandas to infer the format of the datetime strings, which can speed up the conversion process.
- `errors='coerce'` ensures that any errors encountered during the conversion (such as invalid date formats) will result in a `NaT` (Not a Time) value, which is pandas' way of representing missing datetime values.

Extract the year from the amended account_opened column and assign it to the acct_year column.
Print the newly created acct_year column.

# Print the header of account_opend
print(banking['account_opened'].head())

# Convert account_opened to datetime
banking['account_opened'] = pd.to_datetime(banking['account_opened'],
                                           # Infer datetime format
                                           infer_datetime_format = True,
                                           # Return missing value for error
                                           errors = 'coerce') 

# Get year of account opened
banking['acct_year'] = banking['account_opened'].dt.____('%Y')

# Print acct_year
____
```py
# Print the header of account_opend
print(banking['account_opened'].head())

# Convert account_opened to datetime
banking['account_opened'] = pd.to_datetime(banking['account_opened'],
                                           # Infer datetime format
                                           infer_datetime_format = True,
                                           # Return missing value for error
                                           errors = 'coerce')  

# Get year of account opened
banking['acct_year'] = banking['account_opened'].dt.strftime('%Y')

# Print acct_year
print(banking['acct_year'])

```

Certainly! Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Print the header of `account_opened`:**
   ```python
   print(banking['account_opened'].head())
   ```
   - This line prints the first few entries (typically the first five) of the `account_opened` column from the `banking` DataFrame. This is useful for inspecting the initial data and understanding its format before any transformations are applied.

2. **Convert `account_opened` to datetime:**
   ```python
   banking['account_opened'] = pd.to_datetime(banking['account_opened'],
                                              infer_datetime_format=True,
                                              errors='coerce')
   ```
   - This line converts the `account_opened` column to a datetime format using `pd.to_datetime()`.
   - `infer_datetime_format=True` tells pandas to try and infer the format of the datetime strings, which can make the conversion process faster.
   - `errors='coerce'` ensures that any invalid date formats that cannot be converted will be set to `NaT` (Not a Time), which is pandas' representation of missing datetime values.

3. **Get year of account opened:**
   ```python
   banking['acct_year'] = banking['account_opened'].dt.strftime('%Y')
   ```
   - This line extracts the year from each datetime entry in the `account_opened` column and formats it as a string using the `.dt.strftime('%Y')` method.
   - The `%Y` format code specifies that the year should be extracted as a four-digit number.
   - The extracted year is then stored in a new column called `acct_year`.

4. **Print `acct_year`:**
   ```python
   print(banking['acct_year'])
   ```
   - This line prints the entire `acct_year` column, allowing you to see the extracted years for each entry in the DataFrame. This helps verify that the year extraction was successful and that the data is in the expected format.

Overall, this code snippet is designed to convert a column of potentially inconsistent date strings into a consistent datetime format, extract the year from these dates, and store the result in a new column for further analysis.
