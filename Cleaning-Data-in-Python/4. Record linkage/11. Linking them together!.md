# Linking them together!

Linking them together!
In the last lesson, you've finished the bulk of the work on your effort to link restaurants and restaurants_new. You've generated the different pairs of potentially matching rows, searched for exact matches between the cuisine_type and city columns, but compared for similar strings in the rest_name column. You stored the DataFrame containing the scores in potential_matches.

Now it's finally time to link both DataFrames. You will do so by first extracting all row indices of restaurants_new that are matching across the columns mentioned above from potential_matches. Then you will subset restaurants_new on these indices, then append the non-duplicate values to restaurants. All DataFrames are in your environment, alongside pandas imported as pd.

Isolate instances of potential_matches where the row sum is above or equal to 3 by using the .sum() method.
Extract the second column index from matches, which represents row indices of matching record from restaurants_new by using the .get_level_values() method.
Subset restaurants_new for rows that are not in matching_indices.
Append non_dup to restaurants.

# Isolate potential matches with row sum >=3
matches = ____[____.___(____) >= ____]

# Get values of second column index of matches
matching_indices = matches.____.____(____)

# Subset restaurants_new based on non-duplicate values
non_dup = ____[~restaurants_new.index.____(____)]

# Append non_dup to restaurants
full_restaurants = restaurants.____(____)
print(full_restaurants)

# Isolate potential matches with row sum >=3
matches = potential_matches[potential_matches.sum(axis = 1) >= 3]

# Get values of second column index of matches
matching_indices = matches.index.get_level_values(1)

# Subset restaurants_new based on non-duplicate values
non_dup = restaurants_new[~restaurants_new.index.isin(matching_indices)]

# Append non_dup to restaurants
full_restaurants = restaurants.append(non_dup)
print(full_restaurants)

Let's break down each step of the code to understand how it works in the context of linking two DataFrames, `restaurants` and `restaurants_new`, using potential matches:

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Isolate potential matches with row sum >= 3:**

   ```python
   matches = potential_matches[potential_matches.sum(axis=1) >= 3]
   ```

   - **`potential_matches.sum(axis=1)`**: This calculates the sum of values across each row. Each value in the row represents a match score for a specific column (e.g., `city`, `cuisine_type`, `rest_name`).
   - **`>= 3`**: This condition filters the rows where the sum of match scores is 3 or more. This implies that at least three criteria (columns) have matched, indicating a strong likelihood of a duplicate.
   - **`potential_matches[...]`**: This indexing operation selects only those rows from `potential_matches` that meet the condition.

2. **Get values of the second column index of matches:**

   ```python
   matching_indices = matches.index.get_level_values(1)
   ```

   - **`matches.index`**: This accesses the multi-level index of the `matches` DataFrame.
   - **`get_level_values(1)`**: This extracts the values from the second level of the index, which corresponds to the indices of `restaurants_new`. These indices represent the rows in `restaurants_new` that have been identified as potential matches.

3. **Subset `restaurants_new` based on non-duplicate values:**

   ```python
   non_dup = restaurants_new[~restaurants_new.index.isin(matching_indices)]
   ```

   - **`restaurants_new.index.isin(matching_indices)`**: This checks which indices in `restaurants_new` are present in `matching_indices`.
   - **`~`**: This negates the boolean array, effectively selecting indices that are **not** in `matching_indices`.
   - **`restaurants_new[...]`**: This subsets `restaurants_new` to include only those rows that are not identified as duplicates, i.e., those not in `matching_indices`.

4. **Append `non_dup` to `restaurants`:**

   ```python
   full_restaurants = restaurants.append(non_dup)
   ```

   - **`restaurants.append(non_dup)`**: This appends the `non_dup` DataFrame to `restaurants`. The `append()` method combines the two DataFrames, adding the non-duplicate entries from `restaurants_new` to the existing `restaurants` DataFrame.
   - **`print(full_restaurants)`**: This outputs the combined DataFrame, `full_restaurants`, which now includes all original entries from `restaurants` plus the non-duplicate entries from `restaurants_new`.

### Summary:

This process effectively merges the two DataFrames by identifying and excluding duplicates from `restaurants_new` before appending the remaining entries to `restaurants`. The result is a comprehensive DataFrame that includes all unique entries from both sources.
