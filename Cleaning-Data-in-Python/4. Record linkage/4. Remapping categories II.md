# Remapping categories II

Remapping categories II
In the last exercise, you determined that the distance cutoff point for remapping typos of 'american', 'asian', and 'italian' cuisine types stored in the cuisine_type column should be 80.

In this exercise, you're going to put it all together by finding matches with similarity scores equal to or higher than 80 by using fuzywuzzy.process's extract() function, for each correct cuisine type, and replacing these matches with it. Remember, when comparing a string with an array of strings using process.extract(), the output is a list of tuples where each is formatted like:

(closest match, similarity score, index of match)
The restaurants DataFrame is in your environment, and you have access to a categories list containing the correct cuisine types ('italian', 'asian', and 'american').

Return all of the unique values in the cuisine_type column of restaurants
# Inspect the unique values of the cuisine_type column
print(____)


To inspect the unique values in the `cuisine_type` column of the `restaurants` DataFrame, you can use the `unique()` method provided by pandas. Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Inspect the unique values of the cuisine_type column
unique_cuisine_types = restaurants['cuisine_type'].unique()
print(unique_cuisine_types)
```

This code will print out all the unique values present in the `cuisine_type` column, which will help you identify any typos or variations that need to be remapped to the correct categories.

Okay! Looks like you will need to use some string matching to correct these misspellings!

As a first step, create a list of all possible matches, comparing 'italian' with the restaurant types listed in the cuisine_type column.
# Create a list of matches, comparing 'italian' with the cuisine_type column
matches = ____

# Inspect the first 5 matches
print(matches[0:5])

To create a list of matches using `process.extract()` from the `fuzzywuzzy` (or `thefuzz`) library, you need to specify the string you want to match, the list of strings to match against, and the number of matches you want to return. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from thefuzz import process

# Create a list of matches, comparing 'italian' with the cuisine_type column
matches = process.extract('italian', restaurants['cuisine_type'], limit=len(restaurants['cuisine_type']))

# Inspect the first 5 matches
print(matches[0:5])
```

In this code:

- `'italian'` is the string you are trying to match.
- `restaurants['cuisine_type']` is the column you are searching through.
- `limit=len(restaurants['cuisine_type'])` ensures that all potential matches are considered. You can adjust this limit if you only want a certain number of top matches.

Make sure you have the `thefuzz` library installed, as it is the updated version of `fuzzywuzzy`. You can install it using:

```bash
pip install thefuzz
```

This setup will help you identify and inspect the closest matches to 'italian' in your dataset.

Now you're getting somewhere! Now you can iterate through matches to reassign similar entries.

Within the for loop, use an if statement to check whether the similarity score in each match is greater than or equal to 80.
If it is, use .loc to select rows where cuisine_type in restaurants is equal to the current match (which is the first element of match), and reassign them to be 'italian'.

# Create a list of matches, comparing 'italian' with the cuisine_type column
matches = process.extract('italian', restaurants['cuisine_type'], limit=len(restaurants.cuisine_type))

# Iterate through the list of matches to italian
for match in matches:
  # Check whether the similarity score is greater than or equal to 80
  ____:
    # Select all rows where the cuisine_type is spelled this way, and set them to the correct cuisine
    ____

To iterate through the matches and reassign similar entries based on a similarity score threshold, you can use a for loop with an if statement. Here's how you can implement this:

```python
from thefuzz import process

# Create a list of matches, comparing 'italian' with the cuisine_type column
matches = process.extract('italian', restaurants['cuisine_type'], limit=len(restaurants['cuisine_type']))

# Iterate through the list of matches to 'italian'
for match in matches:
    # Check whether the similarity score is greater than or equal to 80
    if match[1] >= 80:
        # Select all rows where the cuisine_type is spelled this way, and set them to the correct cuisine
        restaurants.loc[restaurants['cuisine_type'] == match[0], 'cuisine_type'] = 'italian'
```

In this code:

- `match[0]` is the closest match string.
- `match[1]` is the similarity score.
- The `if` statement checks if the similarity score is 80 or higher.
- `restaurants.loc[...]` is used to select and update the rows in the DataFrame where the `cuisine_type` matches the current match string.

This will ensure that all entries in the `cuisine_type` column that are similar to 'italian' (with a similarity score of 80 or higher) are corrected to 'italian'. You can repeat this process for other correct cuisine types like 'asian' and 'american'.

Finally, you'll adapt your code to work with every restaurant type in categories.

Using the variable cuisine to iterate through categories, embed your code from the previous step in an outer for loop.
Inspect the final result. This has been done for you.

# Iterate through categories
for cuisine in ____:  
  # Create a list of matches, comparing cuisine with the cuisine_type column
  matches = process.extract(____, restaurants['cuisine_type'], limit=len(restaurants.cuisine_type))

  # Iterate through the list of matches
  for match in matches:
     # Check whether the similarity score is greater than or equal to 80
    if match[1] >= 80:
      # If it is, select all rows where the cuisine_type is spelled this way, and set them to the correct cuisine
      restaurants.loc[restaurants['cuisine_type'] == match[0]] = ____
      
# Inspect the final result
print(restaurants['cuisine_type'].unique())

To adapt the code to work with every restaurant type in the `categories` list, you can embed the previous logic inside an outer loop that iterates over each cuisine type in `categories`. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from thefuzz import process

# List of correct cuisine types
categories = ['italian', 'asian', 'american']

# Iterate through categories
for cuisine in categories:  
    # Create a list of matches, comparing cuisine with the cuisine_type column
    matches = process.extract(cuisine, restaurants['cuisine_type'], limit=len(restaurants['cuisine_type']))

    # Iterate through the list of matches
    for match in matches:
        # Check whether the similarity score is greater than or equal to 80
        if match[1] >= 80:
            # If it is, select all rows where the cuisine_type is spelled this way, and set them to the correct cuisine
            restaurants.loc[restaurants['cuisine_type'] == match[0], 'cuisine_type'] = cuisine

# Inspect the final result
print(restaurants['cuisine_type'].unique())
```

In this code:

- The outer loop iterates over each correct cuisine type in the `categories` list.
- For each cuisine type, it generates a list of matches using `process.extract()`.
- The inner loop checks each match to see if the similarity score is 80 or higher.
- If the condition is met, it updates the `cuisine_type` in the DataFrame to the correct cuisine.

This approach ensures that all typos or variations in the `cuisine_type` column are corrected to match the correct categories specified in the `categories` list.
