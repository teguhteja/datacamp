# Pairs of restaurants

Pairs of restaurants
In the last lesson, you cleaned the restaurants dataset to make it ready for building a restaurants recommendation engine. You have a new DataFrame named restaurants_new with new restaurants to train your model on, that's been scraped from a new data source.

You've already cleaned the cuisine_type and city columns using the techniques learned throughout the course. However you saw duplicates with typos in restaurants names that require record linkage instead of joins with restaurants.

In this exercise, you will perform the first step in record linkage and generate possible pairs of rows between restaurants and restaurants_new. Both DataFrames, pandas and recordlinkage are in your environment.

Instantiate an indexing object by using the Index() function from recordlinkage.
Block your pairing on cuisine_type by using indexer's' .block() method.
Generate pairs by indexing restaurants and restaurants_new in that order.

# Create an indexer and object and find possible pairs
indexer = ____

# Block pairing on cuisine_type
indexer.____(____)

# Generate pairs
pairs = indexer.____(____, ____)

To perform record linkage and generate possible pairs of rows between `restaurants` and `restaurants_new`, you can use the `recordlinkage` library. Here's how you can instantiate an indexing object, block the pairing on `cuisine_type`, and generate the pairs:

```python
import recordlinkage

# Create an indexer object
indexer = recordlinkage.Index()

# Block pairing on cuisine_type
indexer.block('cuisine_type')

# Generate pairs
pairs = indexer.index(restaurants, restaurants_new)

# Display the first few pairs
print(pairs[0:5])
```

In this code:

- `recordlinkage.Index()` creates an indexer object that will be used to generate pairs.
- `indexer.block('cuisine_type')` ensures that only records with the same `cuisine_type` are paired, which reduces the number of comparisons and focuses on more likely matches.
- `indexer.index(restaurants, restaurants_new)` generates the pairs of records from the two DataFrames.

This setup will help you efficiently generate potential matches between the two datasets based on the `cuisine_type` column.

Question
Now that you've generated your pairs, you've achieved the first step of record linkage. What are the steps remaining to link both restaurants DataFrames, and in what order?

Possible answers


Compare between columns, score the comparison, then link the DataFrames.

Clean the data, compare between columns, link the DataFrames, then score the comparison.

Clean the data, compare between columns, score the comparison, then link the DataFrames.

The correct sequence of steps to perform record linkage after generating pairs is:

1. **Compare between columns**: Use comparison techniques to evaluate the similarity between the paired records across relevant columns (e.g., restaurant names, addresses).

2. **Score the comparison**: Assign scores to the comparisons to quantify the similarity between records. This often involves using algorithms to calculate similarity scores for each pair.

3. **Link the DataFrames**: Based on the scores, decide which pairs are considered matches and link the DataFrames accordingly.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Compare between columns, score the comparison, then link the DataFrames.**
