# Getting the right index

Getting the right index
Here's a DataFrame named matches containing potential matches between two DataFrames, users_1 and users_2. Each DataFrame's row indices is stored in uid_1 and uid_2 respectively.

             first_name  address_1  address_2  marriage_status  date_of_birth
uid_1 uid_2

To extract all values of the `uid_1` index column from a DataFrame with a multi-level index, you can use the `get_level_values` method. In this case, you can refer to the level by its position (0) or by its name ('uid_1').

Therefore, both of the following options are correct:

- `matches.index.get_level_values(0)`
- `matches.index.get_level_values('uid_1')`

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Both 1 and 3 are correct.**
