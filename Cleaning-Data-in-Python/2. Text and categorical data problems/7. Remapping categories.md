# Remapping categories

Remapping categories
To better understand survey respondents from airlines, you want to find out if there is a relationship between certain responses and the day of the week and wait time at the gate.

The airlines DataFrame contains the day and wait_min columns, which are categorical and numerical respectively. The day column contains the exact day a flight took place, and wait_min contains the amount of minutes it took travelers to wait at the gate. To make your analysis easier, you want to create two new categorical variables:

wait_type: 'short' for 0-60 min, 'medium' for 60-180 and long for 180+
day_week: 'weekday' if day is in the weekday, 'weekend' if day is in the weekend.
The pandas and numpy packages have been imported as pd and np. Let's create some new categorical data!

Create the ranges and labels for the wait_type column mentioned in the description.
Create the wait_type column by from wait_min by using pd.cut(), while inputting label_ranges and label_names in the correct arguments.
Create the mapping dictionary mapping weekdays to 'weekday' and weekend days to 'weekend'.
Create the day_week column by using .replace().

# Create ranges for categories
label_ranges = [0, 60, ____, np.inf]
label_names = ['short', ____, ____]

# Create wait_type column
airlines['wait_type'] = pd.____(____, bins = ____, 
                                labels = ____)

# Create mappings and replace
mappings = {'Monday':'weekday', 'Tuesday':'____', 'Wednesday': '____', 
            'Thursday': '____', '____': '____', 
            'Saturday': 'weekend', '____': '____'}

airlines['day_week'] = airlines['day'].____(mappings)


To create the new categorical variables `wait_type` and `day_week`, you can follow these steps:

1. Define the ranges and labels for the `wait_type` column.
2. Use `pd.cut()` to categorize the `wait_min` column into `wait_type`.
3. Create a mapping dictionary for the `day_week` column.
4. Use `.replace()` to map the days to either 'weekday' or 'weekend'.

Here's how you can implement this:

```python
# Create ranges for categories
label_ranges = [0, 60, 180, np.inf]
label_names = ['short', 'medium', 'long']

# Create wait_type column
airlines['wait_type'] = pd.cut(airlines['wait_min'], bins=label_ranges, labels=label_names)

# Create mappings and replace
mappings = {
    'Monday': 'weekday', 
    'Tuesday': 'weekday', 
    'Wednesday': 'weekday', 
    'Thursday': 'weekday', 
    'Friday': 'weekday', 
    'Saturday': 'weekend', 
    'Sunday': 'weekend'
}

airlines['day_week'] = airlines['day'].replace(mappings)
```

This code will categorize the `wait_min` values into 'short', 'medium', and 'long' based on the specified ranges and map the days of the week to 'weekday' or 'weekend' accordingly.
