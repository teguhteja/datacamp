# Finding consistency

Finding consistency
In this exercise and throughout this chapter, you'll be working with the airlines DataFrame which contains survey responses on the San Francisco Airport from airline customers.

The DataFrame contains flight metadata such as the airline, the destination, waiting times as well as answers to key questions regarding cleanliness, safety, and satisfaction. Another DataFrame named categories was created, containing all correct possible values for the survey columns.

In this exercise, you will use both of these DataFrames to find survey answers with inconsistent values, and drop them, effectively performing an outer and inner join on both these DataFrames as seen in the video exercise. The pandas package has been imported as pd, and the airlines and categories DataFrames are in your environment.

Print the categories DataFrame and take a close look at all possible correct categories of the survey columns.
Print the unique values of the survey columns in airlines using the .unique() method.

# Print categories DataFrame
print(____)

# Print unique values of survey columns in airlines
print('Cleanliness: ', airlines['cleanliness'].____, "\n")
print('Safety: ', ____, "\n")
print('Satisfaction: ', ____, "\n")

To solve this exercise, you need to print the `categories` DataFrame to see the correct possible values for the survey columns. Then, you will print the unique values of the survey columns in the `airlines` DataFrame to identify any inconsistencies. Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Print categories DataFrame
print(categories)

# Print unique values of survey columns in airlines
print('Cleanliness: ', airlines['cleanliness'].unique(), "\n")
print('Safety: ', airlines['safety'].unique(), "\n")
print('Satisfaction: ', airlines['satisfaction'].unique(), "\n")
```

This code will help you compare the unique values in the `airlines` DataFrame with the correct categories in the `categories` DataFrame, allowing you to identify any inconsistencies in the survey responses.

Question
Take a look at the output. Out of the cleanliness, safety and satisfaction columns, which one has an inconsistent category and what is it?

Possible answers


cleanliness because it has an Unacceptable category.

cleanliness because it has a Terribly dirty category.

satisfaction because it has a Very satisfied category.

safety because it has a Neutral category.


To determine which column has an inconsistent category, you need to compare the unique values from the `airlines` DataFrame with the correct categories listed in the `categories` DataFrame. Since I don't have the actual data, I'll guide you on how to identify the inconsistency.

1. **Print the `categories` DataFrame** to see the correct categories for each survey column.
2. **Print the unique values** for each of the survey columns (`cleanliness`, `safety`, `satisfaction`) in the `airlines` DataFrame.

After performing these steps, you should be able to identify any values in the `airlines` DataFrame that do not match the correct categories in the `categories` DataFrame.

Based on the options provided, here's how you can determine the inconsistency:

- **Cleanliness**: Check if there is a category like "Unacceptable" or "Terribly dirty" that is not in the `categories` DataFrame.
- **Safety**: Check if there is a category like "Neutral" that is not in the `categories` DataFrame.
- **Satisfaction**: Check if there is a category like "Very satisfied" that is not in the `categories` DataFrame.

If you find a category in the `airlines` DataFrame that is not listed in the `categories` DataFrame, that is the inconsistent category.

Based on the options provided, if you find "Terribly dirty" in the `cleanliness` column and it is not in the `categories` DataFrame, then the answer would be:

- **Cleanliness because it has a Terribly dirty category.**

Please check the actual data to confirm which category is inconsistent.

Create a set out of the cleanliness column in airlines using set() and find the inconsistent category by finding the difference in the cleanliness column of categories.
Find rows of airlines with a cleanliness value not in categories and print the output.

# Find the cleanliness category in airlines not in categories
cat_clean = ____(____).____(____)

# Find rows with that category
cat_clean_rows = airlines['cleanliness'].____(____)

# Print rows with inconsistent category
print(airlines[____])

To find the inconsistent category in the `cleanliness` column of the `airlines` DataFrame, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a set from the `cleanliness` column in the `airlines` DataFrame.
2. Find the difference between this set and the set of correct categories from the `categories` DataFrame.
3. Identify the rows in the `airlines` DataFrame that have the inconsistent category.

Here's how you can implement this:

```python
# Assuming categories DataFrame has a column 'cleanliness' with correct values
# Find the cleanliness category in airlines not in categories
cat_clean = set(airlines['cleanliness']).difference(set(categories['cleanliness']))

# Find rows with that category
cat_clean_rows = airlines['cleanliness'].isin(cat_clean)

# Print rows with inconsistent category
print(airlines[cat_clean_rows])
```

This code will help you identify and print the rows in the `airlines` DataFrame that have a `cleanliness` value not present in the `categories` DataFrame. Make sure that the `categories` DataFrame has a column named `cleanliness` with the correct categories.

Print the rows with the consistent categories of cleanliness only.

# Find the cleanliness category in airlines not in categories
cat_clean = set(airlines['cleanliness']).difference(categories['cleanliness'])

# Find rows with that category
cat_clean_rows = airlines['cleanliness'].isin(cat_clean)

# Print rows with inconsistent category
print(airlines[cat_clean_rows])

# Print rows with consistent categories only
print(airlines[____])

To print the rows with consistent categories of cleanliness, you need to select the rows where the `cleanliness` values are in the set of correct categories from the `categories` DataFrame. Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Assuming categories DataFrame has a column 'cleanliness' with correct values
# Find the cleanliness category in airlines not in categories
cat_clean = set(airlines['cleanliness']).difference(categories['cleanliness'])

# Find rows with that category
cat_clean_rows = airlines['cleanliness'].isin(cat_clean)

# Print rows with inconsistent category
print(airlines[cat_clean_rows])

# Print rows with consistent categories only
consistent_clean_rows = airlines['cleanliness'].isin(categories['cleanliness'])
print(airlines[consistent_clean_rows])
```

This code will print the rows in the `airlines` DataFrame where the `cleanliness` values are consistent with the correct categories listed in the `categories` DataFrame. Make sure that the `categories` DataFrame has a column named `cleanliness` with the correct categories.
