# Inconsistent categories

Inconsistent categories
In this exercise, you'll be revisiting the airlines DataFrame from the previous lesson.

As a reminder, the DataFrame contains flight metadata such as the airline, the destination, waiting times as well as answers to key questions regarding cleanliness, safety, and satisfaction on the San Francisco Airport.

In this exercise, you will examine two categorical columns from this DataFrame, dest_region and dest_size respectively, assess how to address them and make sure that they are cleaned and ready for analysis. The pandas package has been imported as pd, and the airlines DataFrame is in your environment.

Print the unique values in dest_region and dest_size respectively.

# Print unique values of both columns
print(airlines['dest_region'].____())
print(airlines['____'].____())

Question
From looking at the output, what do you think is the problem with these columns?

Possible answers


The dest_region column has only inconsistent values due to capitalization.

The dest_region column has inconsistent values due to capitalization and has one value that needs to be remapped.

The dest_size column has only inconsistent values due to leading and trailing spaces.

Both 2 and 3 are correct.


To determine the issues with the `dest_region` and `dest_size` columns, you need to examine the unique values printed from these columns. Since I don't have access to the actual data, I'll guide you on how to identify the problems based on the possible answers:

1. **Capitalization Issues in `dest_region`:** Check if the values in `dest_region` have inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "North America" vs. "north america").

2. **Remapping Needed in `dest_region`:** Look for any values that might be incorrect or need to be standardized (e.g., "US" should be "United States").

3. **Leading/Trailing Spaces in `dest_size`:** Check if the values in `dest_size` have leading or trailing spaces that need to be removed (e.g., " Large" vs. "Large").

Based on the possible answers, if you find both capitalization issues and a value that needs remapping in `dest_region`, and also find leading/trailing spaces in `dest_size`, then the correct answer would be:

- **Both 2 and 3 are correct.**

Please review the unique values you printed to confirm which issues are present.

Change the capitalization of all values of dest_region to lowercase.
Replace the 'eur' with 'europe' in dest_region using the .replace() method.

# Print unique values of both columns
print(airlines['dest_region'].unique())
print(airlines['dest_size'].unique())

# Lower dest_region column and then replace "eur" with "europe"
airlines['dest_region'] = airlines['dest_region'].____.____()
airlines['dest_region'] = airlines['dest_region'].____({'____':'____'})

To change the capitalization of all values in the `dest_region` column to lowercase and replace 'eur' with 'europe', you can use the `.str.lower()` method to convert the text to lowercase and the `.replace()` method to substitute the specific value. Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Print unique values of both columns
print(airlines['dest_region'].unique())
print(airlines['dest_size'].unique())

# Lower dest_region column and then replace "eur" with "europe"
airlines['dest_region'] = airlines['dest_region'].str.lower()
airlines['dest_region'] = airlines['dest_region'].replace({'eur': 'europe'})
```

This code will ensure that all values in the `dest_region` column are in lowercase and that any occurrence of 'eur' is replaced with 'europe'.

Strip white spaces from the dest_size column using the .strip() method.
Verify that the changes have been into effect by printing the unique values of the columns using .unique() .

# Print unique values of both columns
print(airlines['dest_region'].unique())
print(airlines['dest_size'].unique())

# Lower dest_region column and then replace "eur" with "europe"
airlines['dest_region'] = airlines['dest_region'].str.lower() 
airlines['dest_region'] = airlines['dest_region'].replace({'eur':'europe'})

# Remove white spaces from `dest_size`
airlines['dest_size'] = airlines['dest_size'].____.____()

# Verify changes have been effected
print(____)
print(____)


To strip white spaces from the `dest_size` column and verify the changes, you can use the `.str.strip()` method. After making the changes, you can print the unique values again to confirm that the modifications have been applied. Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Print unique values of both columns
print(airlines['dest_region'].unique())
print(airlines['dest_size'].unique())

# Lower dest_region column and then replace "eur" with "europe"
airlines['dest_region'] = airlines['dest_region'].str.lower()
airlines['dest_region'] = airlines['dest_region'].replace({'eur': 'europe'})

# Remove white spaces from `dest_size`
airlines['dest_size'] = airlines['dest_size'].str.strip()

# Verify changes have been effected
print(airlines['dest_region'].unique())
print(airlines['dest_size'].unique())
```

This code will ensure that any leading or trailing white spaces in the `dest_size` column are removed, and it will print the unique values of both columns to verify that the changes have been applied correctly.
