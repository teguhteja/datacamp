Removing titles and taking names
While collecting survey respondent metadata in the airlines DataFrame, the full name of respondents was saved in the full_name column. However upon closer inspection, you found that a lot of the different names are prefixed by honorifics such as "Dr.", "Mr.", "Ms." and "Miss".

Your ultimate objective is to create two new columns named first_name and last_name, containing the first and last names of respondents respectively. Before doing so however, you need to remove honorifics.

The airlines DataFrame is in your environment, alongside pandas as pd.

Remove "Dr.", "Mr.", "Miss" and "Ms." from full_name by replacing them with an empty string "" in that order.
Run the assert statement using .str.contains() that tests whether full_name still contains any of the honorifics.

# Replace "Dr." with empty string ""
airlines['full_name'] = airlines['full_name'].____.____("____","")

# Replace "Mr." with empty string ""
airlines['full_name'] = ____

# Replace "Miss" with empty string ""
____

# Replace "Ms." with empty string ""
____

# Assert that full_name has no honorifics
assert airlines['full_name'].str.contains('Ms.|Mr.|Miss|Dr.').any() == False

To remove the honorifics from the `full_name` column in the `airlines` DataFrame, you can use the `.str.replace()` method to replace each honorific with an empty string. After that, you can use an `assert` statement to ensure that none of these honorifics remain in the `full_name` column. Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Replace "Dr." with empty string ""
airlines['full_name'] = airlines['full_name'].str.replace("Dr.", "", regex=False)

# Replace "Mr." with empty string ""
airlines['full_name'] = airlines['full_name'].str.replace("Mr.", "", regex=False)

# Replace "Miss" with empty string ""
airlines['full_name'] = airlines['full_name'].str.replace("Miss", "", regex=False)

# Replace "Ms." with empty string ""
airlines['full_name'] = airlines['full_name'].str.replace("Ms.", "", regex=False)

# Assert that full_name has no honorifics
assert airlines['full_name'].str.contains('Ms.|Mr.|Miss|Dr.').any() == False
```

This code will remove the specified honorifics from the `full_name` column. The `assert` statement checks that none of these honorifics are present in the column after the replacements. Note that the `regex=False` parameter is used to treat the strings as literal strings rather than regular expressions.
