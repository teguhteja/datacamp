# Twitter data to DataFrame

Twitter data to DataFrame
Now you have the Twitter data in a list of dictionaries, tweets_data, where each dictionary corresponds to a single tweet. Next, you're going to extract the text and language of each tweet. The text in a tweet, t1, is stored as the value t1['text']; similarly, the language is stored in t1['lang']. Your task is to build a DataFrame in which each row is a tweet and the columns are 'text' and 'lang'.

Instructions

Use pd.DataFrame() to construct a DataFrame of tweet texts and languages; to do so, the first argument should be tweets_data, a list of dictionaries. The second argument to pd.DataFrame() is a list of the keys you wish to have as columns. Assign the result of the pd.DataFrame() call to df.
Print the head of the DataFrame.

# Import package
import pandas as pd

# Build DataFrame of tweet texts and languages
df = pd.DataFrame(____, columns=____)

# Print head of DataFrame

To create a DataFrame from your list of dictionaries (`tweets_data`) that contains the text and language of each tweet, you can use the `pandas` library. Hereâ€™s how to complete the instructions step by step:

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Import the pandas Library**:
   - Ensure you have imported the `pandas` library to work with DataFrames.

2. **Construct the DataFrame**:
   - Use `pd.DataFrame()` to create a DataFrame by passing the `tweets_data` list as the first argument.
   - Specify the columns you want to include by passing a list of the relevant keys.

3. **Print the DataFrame Head**:
   - Use `df.head()` to print the first few rows of the DataFrame, which gives you a quick overview of the data.

### Complete Code Example

```python
# Import package
import pandas as pd

# Build DataFrame of tweet texts and languages
df = pd.DataFrame(tweets_data, columns=['text', 'lang'])

# Print head of DataFrame
print(df.head())
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Importing pandas**:
   - This line imports the `pandas` library, which is essential for data manipulation and analysis in Python.

2. **Building the DataFrame**:
   - `pd.DataFrame(tweets_data, columns=['text', 'lang'])` constructs a DataFrame where:
     - `tweets_data` is the list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing a tweet.
     - `columns=['text', 'lang']` specifies that the DataFrame should contain two columns: `'text'` (the content of the tweet) and `'lang'` (the language of the tweet).

3. **Printing the DataFrame Head**:
   - `print(df.head())` displays the first five rows of the DataFrame. This is helpful to confirm that your DataFrame is constructed correctly and to inspect the data.

### Conclusion
Running the above code will create a DataFrame from your Twitter data, and the output will show the text and language of the first few tweets. This structure allows for easier data analysis and manipulation in subsequent steps.
