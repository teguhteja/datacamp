# Plotting your Twitter data

Plotting your Twitter data
Now that you have the number of tweets that each candidate was mentioned in, you can plot a bar chart of this data. You'll use the statistical data visualization library seaborn, which you may not have seen before, but we'll guide you through. You'll first import seaborn as sns. You'll then construct a barplot of the data using sns.barplot, passing it two arguments:

a list of labels and
a list containing the variables you wish to plot (clinton, trump and so on.)
Hopefully, you'll see that Trump was unreasonably represented! We have already run the previous exercise solutions in your environment.

Instructions
100 XP
Import both matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn using the aliases plt and sns, respectively.
Complete the arguments of sns.barplot:
The first argument should be the list of labels to appear on the x-axis (created in the previous step).
The second argument should be a list of the variables you wish to plot, as produced in the previous exercise (i.e. a list containing clinton, trump, etc).

# Import packages



# Set seaborn style
sns.set(color_codes=True)

# Create a list of labels:cd
cd = ['clinton', 'trump', 'sanders', 'cruz']

# Plot the bar chart
ax = sns.barplot(____, ____)
ax.set(ylabel="count")
plt.show()


To plot a bar chart of the tweet counts for each candidate using Seaborn, you'll need to import the necessary libraries, create your data lists, and then use the `sns.barplot()` function. Below is the complete step-by-step implementation along with explanations for each part.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Import Required Libraries**:
   - Import `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt` for plotting and `seaborn` as `sns` for advanced statistical plotting.

2. **Set Seaborn Style**:
   - Apply a color style for better aesthetics.

3. **Prepare the Data**:
   - Create a list of labels (candidate names).
   - Prepare a list containing the counts of mentions for each candidate (i.e., `clinton`, `trump`, `sanders`, `cruz`).

4. **Create the Bar Plot**:
   - Use `sns.barplot()` to create the bar chart, passing in the labels and the counts.

5. **Show the Plot**:
   - Display the plot using `plt.show()`.

### Complete Code Example

Here's how you can complete the provided code snippet:

```python
# Import packages
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Set seaborn style
sns.set(color_codes=True)

# Create a list of labels: cd
cd = ['clinton', 'trump', 'sanders', 'cruz']

# Prepare a list of counts for each candidate
counts = [clinton, trump, sanders, cruz]  # assuming these variables have been defined

# Plot the bar chart
ax = sns.barplot(x=cd, y=counts)  # First argument is labels, second is counts
ax.set(ylabel="count")  # Set the y-axis label
plt.show()  # Display the plot
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Importing Libraries**:
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import seaborn as sns
   ```
   - Here, you're importing `matplotlib.pyplot` for basic plotting functions and `seaborn` for enhanced visualization capabilities.

2. **Setting Style**:
   ```python
   sns.set(color_codes=True)
   ```
   - This line applies Seaborn's aesthetic style to the plots, making them look more visually appealing.

3. **Creating Label and Count Lists**:
   ```python
   cd = ['clinton', 'trump', 'sanders', 'cruz']
   counts = [clinton, trump, sanders, cruz]
   ```
   - `cd` is a list of candidate names that will appear on the x-axis.
   - `counts` holds the number of tweets that mention each candidate, which are the variables you've previously counted.

4. **Plotting the Bar Chart**:
   ```python
   ax = sns.barplot(x=cd, y=counts)
   ```
   - This line creates the bar plot. The `x` argument is set to the list of labels, and the `y` argument is set to the list of counts.

5. **Setting Y-axis Label and Showing the Plot**:
   ```python
   ax.set(ylabel="count")
   plt.show()
   ```
   - You set the label for the y-axis to "count" to indicate that it represents the number of tweets. Finally, `plt.show()` displays the bar chart.

### Conclusion
When you run this code, it will generate a bar chart showing the number of mentions for each candidate, allowing you to visually analyze the representation of tweets related to Clinton, Trump, Sanders, and Cruz.
