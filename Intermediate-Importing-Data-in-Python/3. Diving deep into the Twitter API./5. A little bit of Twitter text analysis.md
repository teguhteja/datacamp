# A little bit of Twitter text analysis

A little bit of Twitter text analysis
Now that you have your DataFrame of tweets set up, you're going to do a bit of text analysis to count how many tweets contain the words 'clinton', 'trump', 'sanders' and 'cruz'. In the pre-exercise code, we have defined the following function word_in_text(), which will tell you whether the first argument (a word) occurs within the 2nd argument (a tweet).

import re

def word_in_text(word, text):
    word = word.lower()
    text = text.lower()
    match = re.search(word, text)

    if match:
        return True
    return False
You're going to iterate over the rows of the DataFrame and calculate how many tweets contain each of our keywords! The list of objects for each candidate has been initialized to 0.

Within the for loop for index, row in df.iterrows():, the code currently increases the value of clinton by 1 each time a tweet (text row) mentioning 'Clinton' is encountered; complete the code so that the same happens for trump, sanders and cruz.

# Initialize list to store tweet counts
[clinton, trump, sanders, cruz] = [0, 0, 0, 0]

# Iterate through df, counting the number of tweets in which
# each candidate is mentioned
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    clinton += word_in_text('clinton', row['text'])
    trump += word_in_text(____, ____)
    sanders += word_in_text(____, ____)
    cruz += word_in_text(____, ____)

To complete the text analysis and count how many tweets contain mentions of 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Sanders', and 'Cruz', you'll need to fill in the blanks in the provided code. The `word_in_text()` function will be used to check if each keyword appears in the `text` column of your DataFrame. Here's how you can do it step by step.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Initialize Counts**:
   - Ensure you have a list of counts initialized to zero for each candidate.

2. **Iterate Over the DataFrame**:
   - Use `df.iterrows()` to loop through each row in the DataFrame.

3. **Count Occurrences**:
   - For each candidate, call the `word_in_text()` function and update the corresponding count based on whether the candidate's name is found in the tweet text.

### Complete Code Example

Hereâ€™s the complete code with the missing parts filled in:

```python
# Initialize list to store tweet counts
[clinton, trump, sanders, cruz] = [0, 0, 0, 0]

# Iterate through df, counting the number of tweets in which
# each candidate is mentioned
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    clinton += word_in_text('clinton', row['text'])  # Count for Clinton
    trump += word_in_text('trump', row['text'])      # Count for Trump
    sanders += word_in_text('sanders', row['text'])  # Count for Sanders
    cruz += word_in_text('cruz', row['text'])        # Count for Cruz

# Print out the counts for each candidate
print("Clinton:", clinton)
print("Trump:", trump)
print("Sanders:", sanders)
print("Cruz:", cruz)
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialize Counts**:
   - `[clinton, trump, sanders, cruz] = [0, 0, 0, 0]` sets up four variables, each initialized to zero to track the number of mentions for each candidate.

2. **Iterate Through DataFrame**:
   - `for index, row in df.iterrows():` loops over each row in the DataFrame, allowing access to the index and the row data.

3. **Count Candidate Mentions**:
   - `clinton += word_in_text('clinton', row['text'])` calls the `word_in_text()` function for each candidate. If the candidate's name is found in the tweet text, it increments the respective counter by one.

4. **Print Counts**:
   - The final print statements display the total counts of mentions for each candidate.

### Conclusion
This code will efficiently count how many tweets mention each candidate based on the tweets stored in your DataFrame. After executing the code, you will have the total counts displayed for 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Sanders', and 'Cruz', allowing you to perform further analysis or reporting based on this data.
