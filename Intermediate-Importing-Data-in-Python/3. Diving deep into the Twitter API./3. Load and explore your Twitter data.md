# Load and explore your Twitter data

Load and explore your Twitter data
Now that you've got your Twitter data sitting locally in a text file, it's time to explore it! This is what you'll do in the next few interactive exercises. In this exercise, you'll read the Twitter data into a list: tweets_data.

Be aware that this is real data from Twitter and as such there is always a risk that it may contain profanity or other offensive content (in this exercise, and any following exercises that also use real Twitter data).

Instructions
100 XP
Assign the filename 'tweets.txt' to the variable tweets_data_path.
Initialize tweets_data as an empty list to store the tweets in.
Within the for loop initiated by for line in tweets_file:, load each tweet into a variable, tweet, using json.loads(), then append tweet to tweets_data using the append() method.
Hit submit and check out the keys of the first tweet dictionary printed to the shell.

# Import package
import json

# String of path to file: tweets_data_path


# Initialize empty list to store tweets: tweets_data


# Open connection to file
tweets_file = open(tweets_data_path, "r")

# Read in tweets and store in list: tweets_data
for line in tweets_file:
    ____
    ____

# Close connection to file
tweets_file.close()

# Print the keys of the first tweet dict
print(tweets_data[0].keys())


Here's how you can complete the exercise of loading and exploring your Twitter data from the `tweets.txt` file. Below is a breakdown of each step along with the complete code:

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Assign the Filename**:
   - You need to specify the path of the text file that contains your tweets.

2. **Initialize an Empty List**:
   - Create an empty list where you'll store each tweet after loading it from the file.

3. **Open the File**:
   - Use a context manager to open the file, ensuring it will be properly closed later. Alternatively, you can use `open()` and close it manually.

4. **Load Each Tweet**:
   - Iterate over each line in the file, load the JSON string into a dictionary using `json.loads()`, and append each tweet to the list.

5. **Close the File**:
   - Close the file to free up system resources.

6. **Print the Keys of the First Tweet**:
   - After loading the tweets, print the keys of the first tweet dictionary to see its structure.

### Complete Code Example

```python
# Import package
import json

# String of path to file: tweets_data_path
tweets_data_path = 'tweets.txt'

# Initialize empty list to store tweets: tweets_data
tweets_data = []

# Open connection to file
tweets_file = open(tweets_data_path, "r")

# Read in tweets and store in list: tweets_data
for line in tweets_file:
    tweet = json.loads(line)  # Load each tweet into a variable
    tweets_data.append(tweet)  # Append tweet to the list

# Close connection to file
tweets_file.close()

# Print the keys of the first tweet dict
print(tweets_data[0].keys())
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Importing `json`**:
   - This module is required for converting the JSON formatted string from each line of the text file into a Python dictionary.

2. **Assigning `tweets_data_path`**:
   - This variable holds the path to the text file containing your Twitter data.

3. **Initializing `tweets_data`**:
   - An empty list named `tweets_data` is created to store each tweet as a dictionary.

4. **Opening the File**:
   - The file `tweets.txt` is opened for reading.

5. **Loading Tweets**:
   - A `for` loop iterates over each line in the file. Each line represents a tweet in JSON format. The `json.loads(line)` function converts the JSON string to a Python dictionary. Each dictionary is appended to the `tweets_data` list.

6. **Closing the File**:
   - The file is closed after reading to ensure resources are released.

7. **Printing Keys**:
   - The keys of the first tweet dictionary are printed, which provides insight into the data structure of the tweets you loaded.

### Conclusion
Once you run this code, you should see the keys of the first tweet printed in the console, allowing you to understand the structure of the tweet data you'll be working with in subsequent exercises.
