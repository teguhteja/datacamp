# Performing HTTP requests in Python using requests

Performing HTTP requests in Python using requests
Now that you've got your head and hands around making HTTP requests using the urllib package, you're going to figure out how to do the same using the higher-level requests library. You'll once again be pinging DataCamp servers for their "http://www.datacamp.com/teach/documentation" page.

Note that unlike in the previous exercises using urllib, you don't have to close the connection when using requests!

Instructions

Import the package requests.
Assign the URL of interest to the variable url.
Package the request to the URL, send the request and catch the response with a single function requests.get(), assigning the response to the variable r.
Use the text attribute of the object r to return the HTML of the webpage as a string; store the result in a variable text.
Hit submit to print the HTML of the webpage.

```py
# Import package


# Specify the url: url


# Packages the request, send the request and catch the response: r


# Extract the response: text


# Print the html
print(text)

```

Hereâ€™s how to perform an HTTP GET request using the `requests` library in Python:

```python
# Import package
import requests

# Specify the url: url
url = "http://www.datacamp.com/teach/documentation"

# Packages the request, sends the request, and catches the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Extract the response: text
text = r.text

# Print the html
print(text)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing the Requests Package**: The `requests` package is imported to handle HTTP requests.
2. **Specifying the URL**: The target URL is assigned to the variable `url`.
3. **Sending the Request**: The `requests.get(url)` function is called to send a GET request to the specified URL, and the response is stored in the variable `r`.
4. **Extracting the HTML**: The HTML content of the response is accessed via the `.text` attribute and stored in the variable `text`.
5. **Printing the HTML**: Finally, the HTML content is printed to the console.

This approach simplifies making HTTP requests and handling responses compared to using `urllib`.
