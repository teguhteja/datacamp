# Importing flat files from the web: your turn!

Importing flat files from the web: your turn!
You are about to import your first file from the web! The flat file you will import will be 'winequality-red.csv' from the University of California, Irvine's Machine Learning repository. The flat file contains tabular data of physiochemical properties of red wine, such as pH, alcohol content and citric acid content, along with wine quality rating.

The URL of the file is

'https://assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1606/datasets/winequality-red.csv'
After you import it, you'll check your working directory to confirm that it is there and then you'll load it into a pandas DataFrame.

Import the function urlretrieve from the subpackage urllib.request.
Assign the URL of the file to the variable url.
Use the function urlretrieve() to save the file locally as 'winequality-red.csv'.
Execute the remaining code to load 'winequality-red.csv' in a pandas DataFrame and to print its head to the shell.


```py
# Import package
from ____ import ____

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Assign url of file: url


# Save file locally


# Read file into a DataFrame and print its head
df = pd.read_csv('winequality-red.csv', sep=';')
print(df.head())


```


Here's how you can import the flat file `winequality-red.csv` from the web and load it into a pandas DataFrame:

```python
# Import package
from urllib.request import urlretrieve

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Assign url of file: url
url = 'https://assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1606/datasets/winequality-red.csv'

# Save file locally
urlretrieve(url, 'winequality-red.csv')

# Read file into a DataFrame and print its head
df = pd.read_csv('winequality-red.csv', sep=';')
print(df.head())
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing `urlretrieve`**: This function from the `urllib.request` module is used to download files from the web.
2. **Assigning the URL**: The URL of the `winequality-red.csv` file is assigned to the variable `url`.
3. **Saving the File**: The `urlretrieve()` function downloads the file and saves it locally with the specified filename `'winequality-red.csv'`.
4. **Loading into DataFrame**: The `pd.read_csv()` function reads the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. The `sep=';'` parameter indicates that the file uses semicolons as separators.
5. **Printing the DataFrame**: Finally, `print(df.head())` displays the first few rows of the DataFrame, allowing you to confirm that the data has been loaded correctly. 

This approach enables you to efficiently import data from the web for further analysis.
