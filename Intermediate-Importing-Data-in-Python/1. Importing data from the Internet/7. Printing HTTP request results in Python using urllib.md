# Printing HTTP request results in Python using urllib

Printing HTTP request results in Python using urllib
You have just packaged and sent a GET request to "https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/1606/4135?ex=2" and then caught the response. You saw that such a response is a http.client.HTTPResponse object. The question remains: what can you do with this response?

Well, as it came from an HTML page, you could read it to extract the HTML and, in fact, such a http.client.HTTPResponse object has an associated read() method. In this exercise, you'll build on your previous great work to extract the response and print the HTML.

Instructions

Send the request and catch the response in the variable response with the function urlopen(), as in the previous exercise.
Extract the response using the read() method and store the result in the variable html.
Print the string html.
Hit submit to perform all of the above and to close the response: be tidy!

```py
# Import packages
from urllib.request import urlopen, Request

# Specify the url
url = "https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/1606/4135?ex=2"

# This packages the request
request = Request(url)

# Sends the request and catches the response: response


# Extract the response: html


# Print the html


# Be polite and close the response!
response.close()

```

Here's how to extract and print the HTML response from an HTTP GET request using `urllib`:

```python
# Import packages
from urllib.request import urlopen, Request

# Specify the url
url = "https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/1606/4135?ex=2"

# This packages the request
request = Request(url)

# Sends the request and catches the response: response
response = urlopen(request)

# Extract the response: html
html = response.read()

# Print the html
print(html)

# Be polite and close the response!
response.close()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Request Packaging**: The request is packaged using `Request(url)`.
2. **Sending the Request**: The request is sent using `urlopen(request)`, and the response is caught in the variable `response`.
3. **Reading the Response**: The `read()` method is called on the `response` object to extract the HTML content, which is stored in the variable `html`.
4. **Printing the HTML**: The HTML content is printed to the console.
5. **Closing the Response**: Finally, the connection is closed using `response.close()` to free up resources.
