# Opening and reading flat files from the web

Opening and reading flat files from the web
You have just imported a file from the web, saved it locally and loaded it into a DataFrame. If you just wanted to load a file from the web into a DataFrame without first saving it locally, you can do that easily using pandas. In particular, you can use the function pd.read_csv() with the URL as the first argument and the separator sep as the second argument.

The URL of the file, once again, is

'https://assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1606/datasets/winequality-red.csv'
Instructions

Assign the URL of the file to the variable url.
Read file into a DataFrame df using pd.read_csv(), recalling that the separator in the file is ';'.
Print the head of the DataFrame df.
Execute the rest of the code to plot histogram of the first feature in the DataFrame df.

```py
# Import packages
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Assign url of file: url


# Read file into a DataFrame: df


# Print the head of the DataFrame
print(____)

# Plot first column of df
df.iloc[:, 0].hist()
plt.xlabel('fixed acidity (g(tartaric acid)/dm$^3$)')
plt.ylabel('count')
plt.show()


```

Here's how you can load the `winequality-red.csv` file directly from the web into a pandas DataFrame without saving it locally and plot a histogram of the first feature:

```python
# Import packages
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Assign url of file: url
url = 'https://assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1606/datasets/winequality-red.csv'

# Read file into a DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_csv(url, sep=';')

# Print the head of the DataFrame
print(df.head())

# Plot first column of df
df.iloc[:, 0].hist()
plt.xlabel('fixed acidity (g(tartaric acid)/dm$^3$)')
plt.ylabel('count')
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Assigning the URL**: The URL of the `winequality-red.csv` file is assigned to the variable `url`.
2. **Reading the CSV File**: The `pd.read_csv()` function reads the CSV file directly from the URL and assigns it to the DataFrame `df`. The `sep=';'` parameter specifies that the semicolon is the delimiter.
3. **Printing the DataFrame**: The `print(df.head())` command displays the first few rows of the DataFrame, which helps you confirm that the data has been loaded correctly.
4. **Plotting the Histogram**: The `df.iloc[:, 0].hist()` command plots a histogram of the first column (which is the fixed acidity) of the DataFrame. The x-axis and y-axis are labeled accordingly, and `plt.show()` displays the plot.

This method allows for quick data exploration directly from the web, making it convenient to work with datasets without needing to save them locally.
