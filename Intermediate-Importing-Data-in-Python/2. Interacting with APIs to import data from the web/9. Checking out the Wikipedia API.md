# Checking out the Wikipedia API

Checking out the Wikipedia API
You're doing so well and having so much fun that we're going to throw one more API at you: the Wikipedia API (documented here). You'll figure out how to find and extract information from the Wikipedia page for Pizza. What gets a bit wild here is that your query will return nested JSONs, that is, JSONs with JSONs, but Python can handle that because it will translate them into dictionaries within dictionaries.

The URL that requests the relevant query from the Wikipedia API is

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=extracts&format=json&exintro=&titles=pizza

Assign the relevant URL to the variable url.
Apply the json() method to the response object r and store the resulting dictionary in the variable json_data.
The variable pizza_extract holds the HTML of an extract from Wikipedia's Pizza page as a string; use the function print() to print this string to the shell.

# Import package
import requests

# Assign URL to variable: url


# Package the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Decode the JSON data into a dictionary: json_data


# Print the Wikipedia page extract
pizza_extract = json_data['query']['pages']['24768']['extract']

Here's how you would go about completing this exercise step-by-step:

```python
# Import package
import requests

# Assign URL to variable: url
url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=extracts&format=json&exintro=&titles=pizza'

# Package the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Decode the JSON data into a dictionary: json_data
json_data = r.json()

# Print the Wikipedia page extract
pizza_extract = json_data['query']['pages']['24768']['extract']
print(pizza_extract)
```

### Explanation

1. **URL Setup:**
   - We set `url` to point to the Wikipedia API query with specific parameters:
     - `action=query`: This tells the API we want to retrieve information.
     - `prop=extracts`: Weâ€™re interested in the extract (summary) of the page.
     - `format=json`: The response should be in JSON format.
     - `exintro=`: Only retrieve the introduction section of the page.
     - `titles=pizza`: Search for the page titled "pizza."

2. **Sending the Request:**
   - We use `requests.get(url)` to send a GET request and save the response as `r`.

3. **Decoding JSON:**
   - We use `r.json()` to decode the JSON response into a dictionary `json_data`.

4. **Accessing Nested Data:**
   - We navigate through the nested JSON structure to retrieve the 'extract' field:
     - `json_data['query']['pages']['24768']['extract']` gives us the summary of the "Pizza" Wikipedia page.
   - `24768` is the specific Wikipedia page ID for "Pizza."

5. **Printing the Extract:**
   - Finally, we print `pizza_extract`, which holds the HTML-formatted summary for "Pizza."
