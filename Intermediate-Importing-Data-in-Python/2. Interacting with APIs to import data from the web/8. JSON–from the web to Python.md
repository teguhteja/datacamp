# JSON–from the web to Python

JSON–from the web to Python
Wow, congrats! You've just queried your first API programmatically in Python and printed the text of the response to the shell. However, as you know, your response is actually a JSON, so you can do one step better and decode the JSON. You can then print the key-value pairs of the resulting dictionary. That's what you're going to do now!

Instructions

Pass the variable url to the requests.get() function in order to send the relevant request and catch the response, assigning the resultant response message to the variable r.
Apply the json() method to the response object r and store the resulting dictionary in the variable json_data.
Hit submit to print the key-value pairs of the dictionary json_data to the shell.

# Import package
import requests

# Assign URL to variable: url
url = 'http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=72bc447a&t=social+network'

# Package the request, send the request and catch the response: r


# Decode the JSON data into a dictionary: json_data


# Print each key-value pair in json_data
for k in json_data.keys():
    print(k + ': ', json_data[k])

It sounds like the instructions are clarifying that we just need to pass the `url` variable to `requests.get()` and store the response in `r`. Then, we can decode the JSON data directly by applying `r.json()` to get the dictionary `json_data`. Here’s the solution based exactly on that:

```python
# Import package
import requests

# Assign URL to variable: url
url = 'http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=72bc447a&t=the+social+network'

# Send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Decode the JSON data into a dictionary: json_data
json_data = r.json()

# Print each key-value pair in json_data
for k in json_data.keys():
    print(k + ': ', json_data[k])
```

This keeps the code aligned with your instructions without additional modifications. Try this to see if it works!

```py
# Import package
import requests

# Assign URL to variable: url
url = 'http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=72bc447a&t=social+network'

# Package the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Decode the JSON data into a dictionary: json_data
json_data = r.json()

# Print each key-value pair in json_data
for k in json_data.keys():
    print(k + ': ', json_data[k])
```

Sure, let's go through each line step-by-step to explain the code's functionality:

```python
# Import package
import requests
```

- This line imports the `requests` library, a popular Python library used to send HTTP requests easily. This package allows us to interact with web services, retrieve data, and access APIs.

```python
# Assign URL to variable: url
url = 'http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=72bc447a&t=social+network'
```

- Here, the URL we want to send a request to is stored in the variable `url`.
- The URL is specifically built to make a request to the **OMDB API** for information about the movie **"The Social Network"**. 
- The URL has two query parameters:
  - `apikey=72bc447a` tells the API that we’re authorized (using a key).
  - `t=social+network` specifies the movie title we’re searching for, formatted to replace spaces with `+`.

```python
# Package the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)
```

- This line sends the HTTP GET request to the specified `url`.
- `requests.get(url)` sends the request, and we store the response from the server in the variable `r`.
- The response `r` contains data such as the status code (whether it succeeded or failed) and the content returned by the server, which in this case is in JSON format.

```python
# Decode the JSON data into a dictionary: json_data
json_data = r.json()
```

- Here, we decode the JSON data in `r` (the server's response) into a Python dictionary. 
- `r.json()` is a convenient method from the `requests` library that parses the JSON data automatically, allowing us to interact with it as a dictionary.
- This makes it easy to access specific data points from the response, like the movie title, year, plot, etc.

```python
# Print each key-value pair in json_data
for k in json_data.keys():
    print(k + ': ', json_data[k])
```

- This loop iterates through each key in `json_data`.
- For each key, it prints the key name (e.g., `"Title"`, `"Year"`) and its corresponding value (e.g., `"The Social Network"`, `2010`).
- This effectively displays all of the information we retrieved from the API in a readable format.

In summary, this code sends a request to the OMDB API for movie information on "The Social Network," decodes the JSON response into a dictionary, and prints each piece of information contained in that response.
