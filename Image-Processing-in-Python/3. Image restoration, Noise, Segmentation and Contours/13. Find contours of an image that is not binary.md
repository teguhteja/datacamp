# Find contours of an image that is not binary
Let's work a bit more on how to prepare an image to be able to find its contours and extract information from it.

We'll process an image of two purple dice loaded as image_dice and determine what number was rolled for each dice.

Purple dice
In this case, the image is not grayscale or binary yet. This means we need to perform some image pre-processing steps before looking for the contours. First, we'll transform the image to a 2D array grayscale image and next apply thresholding. Finally, the contours are displayed together with the original image.

color, measure and filters modules are already imported so you can use the functions to find contours and apply thresholding.

We also import the io module to load the image_dice from local memory, using imread. Read more here.

1. Transform the image to grayscale using rgb2gray().

```py
# Make the image grayscale
image_dice = color.____(image_dice)

```

2. Obtain the optimal threshold value for the image and set it as thresh.
```PY
# Make the image grayscale
image_dice = color.rgb2gray(image_dice)

# Obtain the optimal thresh value
thresh = ____(image_dice)

```

To obtain the optimal threshold value for the grayscale image, you can use the `threshold_otsu()` function from the `filters` module in `skimage`. This function applies Otsu's method to determine a threshold that separates the pixel values into two classes (background and foreground). Here’s how you can do it:

```python
# Import the necessary module
from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu

# Make the image grayscale
image_dice = color.rgb2gray(image_dice)

# Obtain the optimal thresh value
thresh = threshold_otsu(image_dice)
```

### Explanation:
- **`from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu`**: This imports the `threshold_otsu` function from the `filters` module of `skimage`.
- **`thresh = threshold_otsu(image_dice)`**: This line calculates the optimal threshold value for the grayscale image stored in `image_dice`, and the result is assigned to the variable `thresh`.

### Next Steps
After obtaining the threshold value, you can apply it to the grayscale image to create a binary image and then find the contours of the dice. If you need assistance with that, feel free to ask!

3. Apply thresholding to the image once you have the optimal threshold value thresh, using the corresponding operator.
```PY
# Make the image grayscale
image_dice = color.rgb2gray(image_dice)

# Obtain the optimal thresh value
thresh = filters.threshold_otsu(image_dice)

# Apply thresholding
binary = image_dice ____ ____

```

To apply thresholding to the grayscale image using the optimal threshold value obtained from Otsu's method, you can use a comparison operator to create a binary image. Here’s how you can do it:

```python
# Make the image grayscale
image_dice = color.rgb2gray(image_dice)

# Obtain the optimal thresh value
thresh = filters.threshold_otsu(image_dice)

# Apply thresholding
binary = image_dice > thresh
```

### Explanation:
- **`binary = image_dice > thresh`**: This line creates a binary image by comparing each pixel in the grayscale image (`image_dice`) to the threshold value (`thresh`). Pixels greater than the threshold are set to `True` (white), and those less than or equal to the threshold are set to `False` (black).

### Next Steps
With the binary image created, you can now proceed to find the contours of the dice and analyze the rolled numbers. If you need help with that, just let me know!


4. Apply the corresponding function to obtain the contours and use a value level of 0.8.

```PY
# Make the image grayscale
image_dice = color.rgb2gray(image_dice)

# Obtain the optimal thresh value
thresh = filters.threshold_otsu(image_dice)

# Apply thresholding
binary = image_dice > thresh

# Find contours at a constant value of 0.8
contours = ____.____(binary, ____)

# Show the image
show_image_contour(image_dice, contours)

```

To find the contours in the binary image using a constant level value of 0.8, you'll need to call the `find_contours()` function from the `measure` module. Here’s how to complete your code:

```python
# Make the image grayscale
image_dice = color.rgb2gray(image_dice)

# Obtain the optimal thresh value
thresh = filters.threshold_otsu(image_dice)

# Apply thresholding
binary = image_dice > thresh

# Find contours at a constant value of 0.8
contours = measure.find_contours(binary, level=0.8)

# Show the image with contours
show_image_contour(image_dice, contours)
```

### Explanation:
- **`measure.find_contours(binary, level=0.8)`**: This line finds the contours in the binary image using the specified level of 0.8.
- **`show_image_contour(image_dice, contours)`**: This line displays the original grayscale image along with the detected contours.

This will help you visualize the contours of the dice on the original image! If you have any further questions or need assistance with the next steps, feel free to ask!
