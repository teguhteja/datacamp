# Let's restore a damaged image

Let's restore a damaged image
In this exercise, we'll restore an image that has missing parts in it, using the inpaint_biharmonic() function.

Small cute puppy
Loaded as defect_image.
We'll work on an image from the data module, obtained by data.astronaut(). Some of the pixels have been replaced with 0s using a binary mask, on purpose, to simulate a damaged image. Replacing pixels with 0s turns them totally black. The defective image is saved as an array called defect_image.

The mask is a black and white image with patches that have the position of the image bits that have been corrupted. We can apply the restoration function on these areas. This mask is preloaded as mask.

Remember that inpainting is the process of reconstructing lost or deteriorated parts of images and videos.

Instructions 1/3
1. Import the inpaint function in the restoration module in scikit-image (skimage).

```py
# Import the module from restoration
from ____.____ import ____
```
It seems the correct function to import is the `inpaint` module from `skimage.restoration`, rather than directly importing `inpaint_biharmonic()`.

Here is the corrected import statement:

```python
# Import the inpaint module from restoration
from skimage.restoration import inpaint
``` 

This ensures you're importing the full `inpaint` module, which contains the necessary functions like `inpaint_biharmonic`.


2. Show the defective image using show_image().
```py
# Import the module from restoration
from skimage.restoration import inpaint

# Show the defective image
show_image(____, 'Image to restore')
```

Here's how you can show the defective image using `show_image()`:

```python
# Import the module from restoration
from skimage.restoration import inpaint

# Show the defective image
show_image(defect_image, 'Image to restore')
``` 

Make sure the variable `defect_image` is already loaded with the correct image data.

3. Call the correct function from inpaint. Use the corrupted image as the first parameter, then the mask and multichannel boolean.
```py
# Import the module from restoration
from skimage.restoration import inpaint

# Show the defective image
show_image(defect_image, 'Image to restore')

# Apply the restoration function to the image using the mask
restored_image = ____.____(____, ____, ____=____)
show_image(restored_image)```

Here is the correct way to call the `inpaint_biharmonic` function:

```python
# Import the module from restoration
from skimage.restoration import inpaint

# Show the defective image
show_image(defect_image, 'Image to restore')

# Apply the restoration function to the image using the mask
restored_image = inpaint.inpaint_biharmonic(defect_image, mask, multichannel=True)

# Show the restored image
show_image(restored_image, 'Restored Image')
``` 

This uses the `inpaint_biharmonic` function with `defect_image`, `mask`, and `multichannel=True` to restore the image.
