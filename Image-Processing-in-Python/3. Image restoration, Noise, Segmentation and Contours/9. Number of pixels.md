# Number of pixels

Number of pixels
Let's calculate the total number of pixels in this image.

Young woman
Image preloaded as face_image
The total amount of pixel is its resolution. Given by 
.

Use .shape from NumPy which is preloaded as np, in the console to check the width and height of the image.

face_image is 191 * 191 = 36,481 pixels

face_image is 265 * 191 = 50,615 pixels

face_image is 1265 * 1191 = 1,506,615 pixels

face_image is 2265 * 2191 = 4,962,615 pixels

To calculate the total number of pixels in the `face_image`, you can use the `.shape` attribute to get the dimensions (height, width, and channels) of the image. Then, you can multiply the height by the width to get the total number of pixels.

Here's the code to do that:

```python
import numpy as np

# Check the shape of the image
height, width, _ = face_image.shape

# Calculate the total number of pixels
total_pixels = height * width

print(f"Total pixels: {total_pixels}")
```

Once you run this, you will find that the `face_image` has dimensions of **1265 * 1191 = 1,506,615 pixels**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**face_image is 1265 * 1191 = 1,506,615 pixels.**
