Import the util module and the random noise function.
Add noise to the image.
Show the original and resulting image.

```py
# Import the module and function
from skimage.____ import ____

# Add noise to the image
noisy_image = ____

# Show original and resulting image
show_image(____, 'Original')
____(____, 'Noisy image')

```

Here is the correct code to add noise to the image:

```python
# Import the module and function
from skimage.util import random_noise

# Add noise to the image
noisy_image = random_noise(fruit_image)

# Show original and resulting image
show_image(fruit_image, 'Original')
show_image(noisy_image, 'Noisy image')
```

This will add random noise to the preloaded `fruit_image` and display both the original and noisy versions.
