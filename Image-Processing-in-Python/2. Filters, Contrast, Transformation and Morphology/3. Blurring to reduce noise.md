# Blurring to reduce noise

Blurring to reduce noise
In this exercise you will reduce the sharpness of an image of a building taken during a London trip, through filtering.

Building in Lodon
Image loaded as building_image.
Instructions
100 XP
Import the Gaussian filter.
Apply the filter to the building_image, set the multichannel parameter to the correct value.
Show the original building_image and resulting gaussian_image.


```py
# Import Gaussian filter 
____

# Apply filter
gaussian_image = ____

# Show original and resulting image to compare
show_image(____, "Original")
____(____, "Reduced sharpness Gaussian")
```

Hereâ€™s how you can fill in the missing parts of the code to apply a Gaussian filter and reduce the sharpness of the image:

```python
# Import Gaussian filter
from skimage.filters import gaussian

# Apply filter, set multichannel=True for color images
gaussian_image = gaussian(building_image, multichannel=True)

# Show original and resulting image to compare
show_image(building_image, "Original")
show_image(gaussian_image, "Reduced sharpness Gaussian")
```

### Explanation:
- **Importing the filter**: We import the `gaussian` filter from `skimage.filters`.
- **Applying the filter**: We apply the Gaussian filter to `building_image`. The `multichannel=True` parameter ensures that the filter correctly processes the image, which is in color (i.e., has multiple channels).
- **Displaying the images**: The `show_image()` function is used to compare the original image with the blurred image.
