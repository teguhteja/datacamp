# Aerial image

Aerial image
In this exercise, we will improve the quality of an aerial image of a city. The image has low contrast and therefore we can not distinguish all the elements in it.

Aerial image, airport taken from the air
Image loaded as image_aerial.
For this we will use the normal or standard technique of Histogram Equalization.

Instructions
100 XP
Import the required module from scikit-image.
Use the histogram equalization function from the module previously imported.
Show the resulting image.

```py
# Import the required module
from ____ import ____

# Use histogram equalization to improve the contrast
image_eq =  ____

# Show the original and resulting image
show_image(image_aerial, 'Original')
show_image(____, 'Resulting image')

```

To improve the quality of the aerial image using histogram equalization, you need to fill in the missing parts of the code. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```python
# Import the required module
from skimage import exposure

# Use histogram equalization to improve the contrast
image_eq = exposure.equalize_hist(image_aerial)

# Show the original and resulting image
show_image(image_aerial, 'Original')
show_image(image_eq, 'Resulting image')
```

### Explanation:
- **Importing the module**: We import the `exposure` module from `scikit-image`, which contains the function for histogram equalization.
- **Applying histogram equalization**: The function `exposure.equalize_hist(image_aerial)` improves the contrast of the original aerial image.
- **Displaying the images**: The `show_image()` function is used to display both the original and the resulting images, allowing for a clear comparison of the improvements made.

This code will enhance the visibility of elements in the aerial image through histogram equalization.
