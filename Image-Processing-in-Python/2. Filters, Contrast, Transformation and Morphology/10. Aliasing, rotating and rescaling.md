# Aliasing, rotating and rescaling

Aliasing, rotating and rescaling
Let's look at the impact of aliasing on images.

Remember that aliasing is an effect that causes different signals, in this case pixels, to become indistinguishable or distorted.

You'll make this cat image upright by rotating it 90 degrees and then rescaling it two times. Once with the anti aliasing filter applied before rescaling and a second time without it, so you can compare them.

1. Import the module and the rotating and rescaling functions.

```py
# Import the module and the rotate and rescale functions
from skimage.____ import ____, ____

```

To import the necessary module along with the `rotate` and `rescale` functions from `skimage`, you can fill in the missing parts of the code as follows:

```python
# Import the module and the rotate and rescale functions
from skimage.transform import rotate, rescale
```

### Explanation:
- **`skimage.transform`**: This is the submodule of `scikit-image` that contains functions for image transformations.
- **`rotate`**: This function is used to rotate the image by a specified angle.
- **`rescale`**: This function is used to change the size of the image while optionally applying an anti-aliasing filter.

This import statement sets you up to rotate and rescale the cat image in the following steps!

2. Rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise.

```py
# Import the module and the rotate and rescale functions
from skimage.transform import rotate, rescale

# Rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise 
rotated_cat_image = ____(image_cat, ____)

```

To rotate the image of the cat 90 degrees clockwise, you can fill in the missing parts of the code as follows:

```python
# Import the module and the rotate and rescale functions
from skimage.transform import rotate, rescale

# Rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise 
rotated_cat_image = rotate(image_cat, angle=-90)
```

### Explanation:
- **`rotate(image_cat, angle=-90)`**: This line rotates the `image_cat` by -90 degrees (which corresponds to a 90-degree clockwise rotation). In the `rotate` function, a negative angle means a clockwise rotation, while a positive angle would indicate a counterclockwise rotation. 

Now you have the cat image rotated correctly!

3. Rescale the cat_image to be 4 times smaller and apply the anti aliasing filter. Set whether or not the image should be treated as multichannel (colored).

``py
# Import the module and the rotate and rescale functions
from skimage.transform import rotate, rescale

# Rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise 
rotated_cat_image = rotate(image_cat, -90)

# Rescale with anti aliasing
rescaled_with_aa = ____(rotated_cat_image, 1/4, ____=____, multichannel=____)
```

To rescale the rotated cat image to be 4 times smaller while applying the anti-aliasing filter, you can fill in the missing parts of the code as follows:

```python
# Import the module and the rotate and rescale functions
from skimage.transform import rotate, rescale

# Rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise 
rotated_cat_image = rotate(image_cat, -90)

# Rescale with anti aliasing
rescaled_with_aa = rescale(rotated_cat_image, 1/4, anti_aliasing=True, multichannel=True)
```

### Explanation:
- **`rescale(rotated_cat_image, 1/4, anti_aliasing=True, multichannel=True)`**:
  - `rotated_cat_image`: The image to be rescaled.
  - `1/4`: The scaling factor; setting it to 1/4 makes the image 4 times smaller.
  - `anti_aliasing=True`: This applies the anti-aliasing filter during the rescaling process, which helps reduce aliasing artifacts.
  - `multichannel=True`: This indicates that the image is colored (i.e., it has multiple channels, such as RGB).

Now you have the rotated cat image rescaled properly with anti-aliasing applied!

4. Rescale the rotated_cat_image to be 4 times smaller without applying an anti aliasing filter.

```py
# Import the module and the rotate and rescale functions
from skimage.transform import rotate, rescale

# Rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise 
rotated_cat_image = rotate(image_cat, -90)

# Rescale with anti aliasing
rescaled_with_aa = rescale(rotated_cat_image, 1/4, anti_aliasing=True, multichannel=True)

# Rescale without anti aliasing
rescaled_without_aa = ____

# Show the resulting images
show_image(rescaled_with_aa, "Transformed with anti aliasing")
show_image(rescaled_without_aa, "Transformed without anti aliasing")

```

To rescale the rotated cat image without applying the anti-aliasing filter, hereâ€™s how you can complete the code:

```python
# Import the module and the rotate and rescale functions
from skimage.transform import rotate, rescale

# Rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise 
rotated_cat_image = rotate(image_cat, -90)

# Rescale with anti aliasing
rescaled_with_aa = rescale(rotated_cat_image, 1/4, anti_aliasing=True, multichannel=True)

# Rescale without anti aliasing
rescaled_without_aa = rescale(rotated_cat_image, 1/4, anti_aliasing=False, multichannel=True)

# Show the resulting images
show_image(rescaled_with_aa, "Transformed with anti aliasing")
show_image(rescaled_without_aa, "Transformed without anti aliasing")
```

### Explanation:
- **`anti_aliasing=False`** disables the anti-aliasing filter while rescaling.
- The rest of the parameters remain the same to ensure a valid comparison between the two versions.

This allows you to compare the effects of applying anti-aliasing versus not applying it when rescaling the image.
