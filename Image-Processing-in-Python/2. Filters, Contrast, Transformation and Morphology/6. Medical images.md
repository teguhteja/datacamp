Medical images
You are trying to improve the tools of a hospital by pre-processing the X-ray images so that doctors have a higher chance of spotting relevant details. You'll test our code on a chest X-ray image from the National Institutes of Health Chest X-Ray Dataset

X-ray chest image

Image loaded as chest_xray_image.
First, you'll check the histogram of the image and then apply standard histogram equalization to improve the contrast. Remember we obtain the histogram by using the hist() function from Matplotlib, which has been already imported as plt.

Import the required Scikit-image module for contrast.

```py
# Import the required module
from ____ import ____```

To perform standard histogram equalization using Scikit-image, you need to import the `exposure` module. Here’s how to fill in the blanks:

```python
# Import the required module
from skimage import exposure
```

### Explanation:
- **Scikit-image Module**: The `exposure` module contains functions for adjusting the exposure of images, including histogram equalization, which enhances the contrast in the image. 

Now you can proceed to use the imported module to apply histogram equalization on your X-ray image after checking its histogram. Let me know if you need help with the next steps!


2. Show the histogram from the original x-ray image chest_xray_image, using the hist() function.

```py
# Import the required module
from skimage import exposure

# Show original x-ray image and its histogram
show_image(chest_xray_image, 'Original x-ray')

plt.title('Histogram of image')
plt.____(____.ravel(), bins=____)
plt.show()
```

To display the histogram of the original X-ray image using the `hist()` function from Matplotlib, you need to fill in the blanks for the `plt.hist()` function. Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Import the required module
from skimage import exposure

# Show original x-ray image and its histogram
show_image(chest_xray_image, 'Original x-ray')

plt.title('Histogram of image')
plt.hist(chest_xray_image.ravel(), bins=256, color='black', alpha=0.7)  # Use 256 bins for pixel intensity values
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:
- **`chest_xray_image.ravel()`**: This flattens the image array into a 1D array, which is suitable for histogram plotting.
- **`bins=256`**: This specifies the number of bins for the histogram, which corresponds to the possible pixel intensity values (0-255 for an 8-bit image).
- **`color='black', alpha=0.7`**: This sets the color and transparency of the histogram bars, making it visually clearer.

3. This code will display both the original X-ray image and its histogram, helping you to analyze the pixel intensity distribution.

Use histogram equalization on chest_xray_image to obtain the improved image and load it as xray_image_eq.


```py
# Import the required module
from skimage import exposure

# Show original x-ray image and its histogram
show_image(chest_xray_image, 'Original x-ray')

plt.title('Histogram of image')
plt.hist(chest_xray_image.ravel(), bins=256)
plt.show()

# Use histogram equalization to improve the contrast
xray_image_eq =  ____.____(chest_xray_image)
```

To perform histogram equalization on the `chest_xray_image` and store the result in `xray_image_eq`, you can use the `equalize_hist` function from the `exposure` module. Here's the complete code:

```python
# Import the required module
from skimage import exposure

# Show original x-ray image and its histogram
show_image(chest_xray_image, 'Original x-ray')

plt.title('Histogram of image')
plt.hist(chest_xray_image.ravel(), bins=256)
plt.show()

# Use histogram equalization to improve the contrast
xray_image_eq = exposure.equalize_hist(chest_xray_image)

# Show the equalized x-ray image
show_image(xray_image_eq, 'Equalized x-ray')
```

### Explanation:
- **`exposure.equalize_hist(chest_xray_image)`**: This function applies histogram equalization to the input image, enhancing its contrast by redistributing the pixel intensity values across the entire range.
- **Display the equalized image**: After performing histogram equalization, it’s helpful to visualize the result to see the improvement in contrast.

4. This code will show both the original X-ray image and the equalized image, allowing you to compare the effects of histogram equalization.

Show the resulting improved image xray_image_eq.

```py
# Import the required module
from skimage import exposure

# Show original x-ray image and its histogram
show_image(chest_xray_image, 'Original x-ray')

plt.title('Histogram of image')
plt.hist(chest_xray_image.ravel(), bins=256)
plt.show()

# Use histogram equalization to improve the contrast
xray_image_eq =  exposure.equalize_hist(chest_xray_image)

# Show the resulting image
show_image(____, 'Resulting image')
```

To display the resulting improved image after histogram equalization, you simply need to fill in the blank with `xray_image_eq`. Here’s the complete code:

```python
# Import the required module
from skimage import exposure

# Show original x-ray image and its histogram
show_image(chest_xray_image, 'Original x-ray')

plt.title('Histogram of image')
plt.hist(chest_xray_image.ravel(), bins=256)
plt.show()

# Use histogram equalization to improve the contrast
xray_image_eq = exposure.equalize_hist(chest_xray_image)

# Show the resulting image
show_image(xray_image_eq, 'Resulting image')
```

### Explanation:
- **`show_image(xray_image_eq, 'Resulting image')`**: This line displays the equalized X-ray image, allowing you to compare it directly with the original image and observe the enhancements made by histogram equalization.

By running this code, you will visualize the improved X-ray image along with the original image and its histogram.
