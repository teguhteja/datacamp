# Proportionally resizing

Proportionally resizing
We want to downscale the images of a veterinary blog website so all of them have the same compressed size.

It's important that you do this proportionally, meaning that these are not distorted.

First, you'll try it out for one image so you know what code to test later in the rest of the pictures.


The image preloaded as dogs_banner.
Remember that by looking at the shape of the image, you can know its width and height.

Instructions
100 XP
Import the module and function to resize.
Set the proportional height and width so it is half the image's height size.
Resize using the calculated proportional height and width.

```py
# Import the module and function
from skimage.___ import ____

# Set proportional height so its half its size
height = int(____ / 2)
width = int(____ / 2)

# Resize using the calculated proportional height and width
image_resized = ____(dogs_banner, (____, ____),
                       anti_aliasing=True)

# Show the original and resized image
show_image(dogs_banner, 'Original')
show_image(image_resized, 'Resized image')
```

Here’s how to complete the exercise for proportionally resizing the `dogs_banner` image:

```python
# Import the module and function
from skimage.transform import resize

# Set proportional height so its half its size
height = int(dogs_banner.shape[0] / 2)
width = int(dogs_banner.shape[1] / 2)

# Resize using the calculated proportional height and width
image_resized = resize(dogs_banner, (height, width), anti_aliasing=True)

# Show the original and resized image
show_image(dogs_banner, 'Original')
show_image(image_resized, 'Resized image')
```

### Explanation:
1. **`from skimage.transform import resize`**: This imports the `resize` function used for resizing images.
2. **`height = int(dogs_banner.shape[0] / 2)`**: This calculates the new height as half of the original image's height.
3. **`width = int(dogs_banner.shape[1] / 2)`**: This calculates the new width as half of the original image's width.
4. **`resize(dogs_banner, (height, width), anti_aliasing=True)`**: This resizes the `dogs_banner` image to the new dimensions while applying anti-aliasing to minimize distortion.
5. **`show_image(dogs_banner, 'Original')` and `show_image(image_resized, 'Resized image')`**: These display the original and resized images for comparison. 

With this code, you will ensure that the resized image maintains the original aspect ratio.
