What's the contrast of this image?
Black and white clock hanging and moving Histogram of the clock's image

The histogram tell us.

Just as we saw previously, you can calculate the contrast by calculating the range of the pixel intensities i.e. by subtracting the minimum pixel intensity value from the histogram to the maximum one.

You can obtain the maximum pixel intensity of the image by using the np.max() method from NumPy and the minimum with np.min() in the console.

The image has already been loaded as clock_image, NumPy as np and the show_image() function.

The contrast is 255 (high contrast).

The contrast is 148.

The contrast is 189.

The contrast is 49 (low contrast).

# Calculate the maximum and minimum pixel intensity values
max_intensity = np.max(clock_image)
min_intensity = np.min(clock_image)

# Calculate the contrast
contrast = max_intensity - min_intensity

# Print the result
print(f"The contrast of the image is: {contrast}")
