Let's add some impact and contrast
Have you ever wanted to enhance the contrast of your photos so that they appear more dramatic?

In this exercise, you'll increase the contrast of a cup of coffee. Something you could share with your friends on social media. Don't forget to use #ImageProcessingDatacamp as hashtag!

Even though this is not our Sunday morning coffee cup, you can still apply the same methods to any of our photos.

Cup of coffee
A function called show_image(), that displays an image using Matplotlib, has already been defined. It has the arguments image and title, with title being 'Original' by default.

Instructions

Import the module that includes the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) function.
Obtain the image you'll work on, with a cup of coffee in it, from the module that holds all the images for testing purposes.
From the previously imported module, call the function to apply the adaptive equalization method on the original image and set the clip limit to 0.03.

```py
# Import the necessary modules
from skimage import data, ____

# Load the image
original_image = ____.coffee()

# Apply the adaptive equalization on the original image
adapthist_eq_image = ____.____(original_image, ____=____)

# Compare the original image to the equalized
show_image(original_image)
show_image(adapthist_eq_image, '#ImageProcessingDatacamp')


```

To enhance the contrast of the coffee image using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), you can fill in the missing parts of the code as follows:

```python
# Import the necessary modules
from skimage import data, exposure

# Load the image
original_image = data.coffee()

# Apply the adaptive equalization on the original image
adapthist_eq_image = exposure.equalize_adapthist(original_image, clip_limit=0.03)

# Compare the original image to the equalized
show_image(original_image)
show_image(adapthist_eq_image, '#ImageProcessingDatacamp')
```

### Explanation:
- **Importing the module**: The `exposure` module from `skimage` contains the function for CLAHE.
- **Loading the image**: The `data.coffee()` function loads the image of a cup of coffee.
- **Applying CLAHE**: The `exposure.equalize_adapthist()` function is called with the original image and a clip limit of 0.03 to enhance contrast adaptively.
- **Displaying the images**: The `show_image()` function is used to display both the original and the equalized images, allowing for a visual comparison.

This code will enhance the visual appeal of the coffee image, making it more dramatic and suitable for sharing!
