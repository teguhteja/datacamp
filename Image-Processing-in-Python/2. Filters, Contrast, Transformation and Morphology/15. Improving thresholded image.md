# Improving thresholded image

Improving thresholded image
In this exercise, we'll try to reduce the noise of a thresholded image using the dilation morphological operation.

World map
Image already loaded as world_image.
This operation, in a way, expands the objects in the image.

Instructions
100 XP
Import the module.
Obtain the binarized and dilated image, from the original image world_image.

```py
# Import the module
from skimage import ____

# Obtain the dilated image 
dilated_image = ____

# See results
show_image(world_image, 'Original')
show_image(dilated_image, 'Dilated image')
```

To perform the dilation morphological operation on the `world_image`, you need to import the appropriate module and apply the dilation function. Here's the completed code:

```python
# Import the module
from skimage import morphology

# Obtain the dilated image using the dilation operation
dilated_image = morphology.dilation(world_image)

# See results
show_image(world_image, 'Original')
show_image(dilated_image, 'Dilated image')
```

### Explanation:
1. **`from skimage import morphology`**: This imports the morphological functions, including dilation.
2. **`morphology.dilation(world_image)`**: This function applies the dilation operation to the `world_image`, which helps to expand the objects in the image, effectively reducing noise in the thresholded image.
3. **`show_image(world_image, 'Original')`**: Displays the original world image.
4. **`show_image(dilated_image, 'Dilated image')`**: Displays the image after dilation, allowing you to compare it with the original.

Dilation is particularly useful in image processing tasks like noise reduction, as it can help fill small holes and connect disjointed regions in the thresholded image.
