# Is this gray or full of color?

Is this gray or full of color?
Whats the main difference between the images shown below?

Image of coffee next to coins image
These images have been preloaded as coffee_image and coins_image from the scikit-image data module using:

coffee_image = data.coffee()
coins_image = data.coins()
Choose the right answer that best describes the main difference related to color and dimensional structure.

In the console, use the function shape() from NumPy, to obtain the image shape (Height, Width, Dimensions) and find out. NumPy is already imported as np.

Both have 3 channels for RGB-3 color representation.

coffee_image has a shape of (303, 384), grayscale. And coins_image (400, 600, 3), RGB-3.

coins_image has a shape of (303, 384), grayscale. And coffee_image (400, 600, 3), RGB-3.

Both are grayscale, with single color dimension.

Based on the descriptions of the images and their shapes:

- `coffee_image` has a shape of (303, 384), which indicates it is grayscale with a single color dimension.
- `coins_image` has a shape of (400, 600, 3), indicating it is RGB-3 color representation.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**coins_image has a shape of (400, 600, 3), RGB-3.**

This choice correctly identifies the difference in color representation (RGB-3 for coins_image) and dimensional structure compared to the grayscale `coffee_image`.
