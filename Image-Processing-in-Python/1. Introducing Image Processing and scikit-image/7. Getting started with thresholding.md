Histograms
In this exercise, you will analyze the amount of red in the image. To do this, the histogram of the red channel will be computed for the image shown below:

Image loaded as image.
Extracting information from images is a fundamental part of image enhancement. This way you can balance the red and blue to make the image look colder or warmer.

You will use hist() to display the 256 different intensities of the red color. And ravel() to make these color values an array of one flat dimension.

Matplotlib is preloaded as plt and Numpy as np.

Remember that if we want to obtain the green color of an image we would do the following:

green = image[:, :, 1]

Obtain the red channel using slicing.
Plot the histogram and bins in a range of 256. Don't forget .ravel() for the color channel.

```py
# Obtain the red channel
red_channel = image[____, ____, ____]

# Plot the red histogram with bins in a range of 256
plt.____(____.____, bins=____)

# Set title and show
plt.title('Red Histogram')
plt.show()

```

To analyze the amount of red in the image and plot the histogram, you can complete the code as follows:

1. **Extract the red channel from the image using slicing**.
2. **Use `plt.hist()` to plot the histogram of the red channel**.
3. **Use `np.ravel()` to flatten the channel**.

Hereâ€™s how the code should look:

```python
# Obtain the red channel
red_channel = image[:, :, 0]  # The red channel is the first channel (index 0)

# Plot the red histogram with bins in a range of 256
plt.hist(red_channel.ravel(), bins=256)  # Flatten the channel and set bins to 256

# Set title and show
plt.title('Red Histogram')
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:
- **Red Channel Extraction**: `red_channel = image[:, :, 0]` slices the image to obtain the first channel, which corresponds to the red color.
- **Plotting the Histogram**: `plt.hist(red_channel.ravel(), bins=256)` flattens the 2D array of red values into a 1D array and plots the histogram with 256 bins.
- **Title and Display**: The title is set to 'Red Histogram', and `plt.show()` displays the histogram.

This code will allow you to visualize the distribution of red intensities in the image.
