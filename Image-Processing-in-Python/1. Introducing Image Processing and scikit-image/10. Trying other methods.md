# Trying other methods

Trying other methods
As we saw in the video, not being sure about what thresholding method to use isn't a problem. In fact, scikit-image provides us with a function to check multiple methods and see for ourselves what the best option is. It returns a figure comparing the outputs of different global thresholding methods.

Forest fruits
Image loaded as fruits_image.
You will apply this function to this image, matplotlib.pyplot has been loaded as plt. Remember that you can use try_all_threshold() to try multiple global algorithms.

Instructions
100 XP
Import the try all function.
Import the rgb to gray convertor function.
Turn the fruits image to grayscale.
Use the try all method on the resulting grayscale image.

```py
# Import the try all function
from skimage.____ import ____

# Import the rgb to gray convertor function 
from skimage.____ import ____

# Turn the fruits_image to grayscale
grayscale = ____

# Use the try all method on the resulting grayscale image
fig, ax = ____(____, verbose=False)

# Show the resulting plots
plt.show()
```

To try multiple global thresholding methods on the `fruits_image`, you can use the `try_all_threshold()` function from `skimage.filters` and convert the image to grayscale using `rgb2gray()`.

Here's the completed code:

```python
# Import the try all function
from skimage.filters import try_all_threshold

# Import the rgb to gray convertor function 
from skimage.color import rgb2gray

# Turn the fruits_image to grayscale
grayscale = rgb2gray(fruits_image)

# Use the try all method on the resulting grayscale image
fig, ax = try_all_threshold(grayscale, verbose=False)

# Show the resulting plots
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:
- **Importing Functions**:
  - `from skimage.filters import try_all_threshold`: Imports the function to apply multiple global thresholding methods.
  - `from skimage.color import rgb2gray`: Imports the function to convert an RGB image to grayscale.
  
- **Convert to Grayscale**: `grayscale = rgb2gray(fruits_image)` converts the `fruits_image` to a grayscale image, as thresholding works on single-channel images.

- **Applying `try_all_threshold()`**: `fig, ax = try_all_threshold(grayscale, verbose=False)` runs multiple global thresholding algorithms on the grayscale image and plots the results. Setting `verbose=False` suppresses detailed output.

- **Show the Plots**: `plt.show()` displays the figure comparing the results of various thresholding methods.

This will allow you to visually compare the outcomes of different thresholding techniques and determine which one works best for the `fruits_image`.
