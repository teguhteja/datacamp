Flipping out
As a prank, someone has turned an image from a photo album of a trip to Seville upside-down and back-to-front! Now, we need to straighten the image, by flipping it.

City of Seville upside-down
Image loaded as flipped_seville.
Using the NumPy methods learned in the course, flip the image horizontally and vertically. Then display the corrected image using the show_image() function.
NumPy is already imported as np.

To flip the image vertically using NumPy, you can use the `np.flipud()` function, which flips the image upside down (along the vertical axis). Here’s how you would complete that step:

```python
# Flip the image vertically
seville_vertical_flip = np.flipud(flipped_seville)
```

### Explanation:
- **`np.flipud()`**: This function flips the input array (in this case, the image `flipped_seville`) upside down.

Now, you can proceed with the next steps in your exercise to flip the image horizontally and display it. If you need assistance with those steps as well, let me know!

To flip the vertically-flipped image horizontally using NumPy, you can use the `np.fliplr()` function. Here’s how you can complete that step:

```python
# Flip the vertically-flipped image horizontally
seville_horizontal_flip = np.fliplr(seville_vertical_flip)
```

### Explanation:
- **`np.fliplr()`**: This function flips the input array (in this case, the vertically flipped image `seville_vertical_flip`) left to right.

### Complete Code Snippet
Putting it all together, your code would look like this:

```python
# Flip the image vertically
seville_vertical_flip = np.flipud(flipped_seville)

# Flip the vertically-flipped image horizontally
seville_horizontal_flip = np.fliplr(seville_vertical_flip)

# Show the corrected image
show_image(seville_horizontal_flip, 'Corrected Seville Image')
```

This code will flip the original upside-down and back-to-front image, resulting in the correctly oriented image of Seville.
