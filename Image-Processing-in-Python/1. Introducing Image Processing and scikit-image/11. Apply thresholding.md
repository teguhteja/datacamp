# Apply thresholding

Apply thresholding
In this exercise, you will decide what type of thresholding is best used to binarize an image of knitting and craft tools. In doing so, you will be able to see the shapes of the objects, from paper hearts to scissors more clearly.

Several tools for handcraft art
Image loaded as tools_image.
What type of thresholding would you use judging by the characteristics of the image? Is the background illumination and intensity even or uneven?

Instructions
100 XP
Import the appropriate thresholding and rgb2gray() functions.
Turn the image to grayscale.
Obtain the optimal thresh.
Obtain the binary image by applying thresholding.

```py
# Import threshold and gray convertor functions
from skimage.____ import ____
from skimage.color import ____

# Turn the image grayscale
gray_tools_image = ____

# Obtain the optimal thresh
thresh = ____(gray_tools_image)

# Obtain the binary image by applying thresholding
binary_image = gray_tools_image > ____

# Show the resulting binary image
show_image(binary_image, 'Binarized image')
```

Hereâ€™s the complete code to apply the appropriate thresholding method and binarize the image of knitting and craft tools (`tools_image`):

```python
# Import threshold and gray convertor functions
from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu
from skimage.color import rgb2gray

# Turn the image grayscale
gray_tools_image = rgb2gray(tools_image)

# Obtain the optimal thresh using Otsu's method
thresh = threshold_otsu(gray_tools_image)

# Obtain the binary image by applying thresholding
binary_image = gray_tools_image > thresh

# Show the resulting binary image
show_image(binary_image, 'Binarized image')
```

### Explanation:
- **Importing Functions**:
  - `from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu`: Imports Otsu's thresholding function for global thresholding.
  - `from skimage.color import rgb2gray`: Imports the function to convert the image from RGB to grayscale.
  
- **Convert to Grayscale**: `gray_tools_image = rgb2gray(tools_image)` converts the original `tools_image` to grayscale.
  
- **Optimal Threshold Calculation**: `thresh = threshold_otsu(gray_tools_image)` calculates the optimal global threshold using Otsu's method.
  
- **Apply Thresholding**: `binary_image = gray_tools_image > thresh` creates the binary image by comparing each pixel's intensity against the calculated threshold.

- **Displaying the Binary Image**: `show_image(binary_image, 'Binarized image')` displays the resulting binary image.

### Which Thresholding Method to Use?
Based on the image characteristics (even lighting and uniform background), Otsu's global thresholding is an appropriate method to separate the objects clearly from the background.
