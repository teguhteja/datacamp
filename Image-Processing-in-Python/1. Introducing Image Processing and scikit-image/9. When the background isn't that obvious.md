# When the background isn't that obvious

Apply global thresholding
In this exercise, you'll transform a photograph to binary so you can separate the foreground from the background.

To do so, you need to import the required modules, load the image, obtain the optimal thresh value using threshold_otsu() and apply it to the image.

You'll see the resulting binarized image when using the show_image() function, previously explained.

Remember we have to turn colored images to grayscale. For that we will use the rgb2gray() function learned in previous video. Which has already been imported for you.

Apply thresholding to the image.

```py
# Import the otsu threshold function
from skimage.____ import ____

# Obtain the optimal threshold value with otsu
thresh = ____(____)

# Apply thresholding to the image
binary = chess_pieces_image_gray ____ ____

# Show the image
show_image(binary, 'Binary image')

```

To complete the exercise of applying global thresholding to the chess pieces image, you need to fill in the blanks as follows:

1. **Import the `threshold_otsu` function from the `skimage.filters` module.**
2. **Convert the colored image to grayscale using `rgb2gray()`.**
3. **Obtain the optimal threshold value.**
4. **Apply thresholding using the threshold value.**

Here’s the completed code:

```python
# Import the otsu threshold function
from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu

# Make the image grayscale using rgb2gray
chess_pieces_image_gray = rgb2gray(chess_pieces_image)

# Obtain the optimal threshold value with otsu
thresh = threshold_otsu(chess_pieces_image_gray)

# Apply thresholding to the image
binary = chess_pieces_image_gray > thresh  # Create a binary image

# Show the image
show_image(binary, 'Binary image')
```

### Explanation:
- **Importing Otsu's Function**: `from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu` imports the Otsu thresholding function from the `filters` module.
- **Grayscale Conversion**: `chess_pieces_image_gray = rgb2gray(chess_pieces_image)` converts the original colored image to grayscale.
- **Optimal Threshold Calculation**: `thresh = threshold_otsu(chess_pieces_image_gray)` calculates the optimal threshold value for the grayscale image.
- **Applying Thresholding**: `binary = chess_pieces_image_gray > thresh` creates a binary image where all pixels with values greater than the threshold are set to `True` (or 1) and all others are set to `False` (or 0).
- **Displaying the Result**: Finally, `show_image(binary, 'Binary image')` displays the resulting binary image.

This code will allow you to visualize the separation between the foreground (chess pieces) and the background in the image.


# Trying other methods

When the background isn't that obvious
Sometimes, it isn't that obvious to identify the background. If the image background is relatively uniform, then you can use a global threshold value as we practiced before, using threshold_otsu(). However, if there's uneven background illumination, adaptive thresholding threshold_local() (a.k.a. local thresholding) may produce better results.

In this exercise, you will compare both types of thresholding methods (global and local), to find the optimal way to obtain the binary image we need.

Import the local threshold function, set block size to 35, obtain the local thresh value, and apply local thresholding.

```py
# Import the otsu threshold function
from skimage.____ import ____

# Obtain the optimal otsu global thresh value
global_thresh = ____(page_image)

# Obtain the binary image by applying global thresholding
binary_global = page_image ____ ____

# Show the binary image obtained
show_image(binary_global, 'Global thresholding')


```
To compare global and local thresholding methods on the page image, you can fill in the blanks for the global thresholding part of the exercise as follows:

1. **Import the `threshold_otsu` function from the `skimage.filters` module.**
2. **Obtain the optimal global threshold value using Otsu's method.**
3. **Apply global thresholding to create a binary image.**

Here’s the completed code for the global thresholding part:

```python
# Import the otsu threshold function
from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu

# Obtain the optimal otsu global thresh value
global_thresh = threshold_otsu(page_image)

# Obtain the binary image by applying global thresholding
binary_global = page_image > global_thresh  # Create a binary image

# Show the binary image obtained
show_image(binary_global, 'Global thresholding')
```

### Explanation:
- **Importing Otsu's Function**: `from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu` imports the Otsu thresholding function from the `filters` module.
- **Calculating Global Threshold**: `global_thresh = threshold_otsu(page_image)` calculates the optimal global threshold value for the image.
- **Applying Global Thresholding**: `binary_global = page_image > global_thresh` creates a binary image by setting pixels greater than the threshold to `True` (or 1) and others to `False` (or 0).
- **Displaying the Binary Image**: Finally, `show_image(binary_global, 'Global thresholding')` displays the resulting binary image obtained from global thresholding.

Now, for the second part of the exercise, you can use local thresholding. Here’s how you can complete that:

```python
# Import the local threshold function
from skimage.filters import threshold_local

# Set block size for local thresholding
block_size = 35

# Obtain the local threshold value
local_thresh = threshold_local(page_image, block_size)

# Apply local thresholding to the image
binary_local = page_image > local_thresh  # Create a binary image using local threshold

# Show the binary image obtained from local thresholding
show_image(binary_local, 'Local thresholding')
```

### Explanation for Local Thresholding:
- **Importing Local Threshold Function**: `from skimage.filters import threshold_local` imports the local thresholding function.
- **Setting Block Size**: `block_size = 35` defines the size of the local region used to compute the threshold.
- **Calculating Local Threshold**: `local_thresh = threshold_local(page_image, block_size)` computes the local threshold for each pixel based on its neighbors within the specified block size.
- **Applying Local Thresholding**: `binary_local = page_image > local_thresh` creates a binary image using local thresholds.
- **Displaying the Local Binary Image**: `show_image(binary_local, 'Local thresholding')` displays the resulting binary image obtained from local thresholding.

By running both sections of code, you will be able to compare the results of global and local thresholding on the page image.

Import the local threshold function

```py
# Import the local threshold function
from skimage.____ import ____

# Set the block size to 35
block_size = ____

# Obtain the optimal local thresholding
local_thresh = ____(____, ____, offset=10)

# Obtain the binary image by applying local thresholding
binary_local = page_image ____ ____

# Show the binary image
show_image(binary_local, 'Local thresholding')

```

To apply local thresholding, you will need to complete the code by importing the `threshold_local` function and filling in the appropriate values for the block size and the application of the local threshold.

Here’s the completed code:

```python
# Import the local threshold function
from skimage.filters import threshold_local

# Set the block size to 35
block_size = 35

# Obtain the optimal local thresholding
local_thresh = threshold_local(page_image, block_size, offset=10)

# Obtain the binary image by applying local thresholding
binary_local = page_image > local_thresh

# Show the binary image
show_image(binary_local, 'Local thresholding')
```

### Explanation:
- **Importing Local Threshold Function**: `from skimage.filters import threshold_local` imports the local thresholding function from `skimage.filters`.
- **Block Size**: `block_size = 35` defines the size of the local region around each pixel that is used to compute the threshold.
- **Offset**: The `offset=10` shifts the threshold value by 10 to make the thresholding more or less sensitive.
- **Local Threshold Application**: `binary_local = page_image > local_thresh` creates a binary image where each pixel is compared against the local threshold calculated in its neighborhood.
- **Displaying the Image**: Finally, `show_image(binary_local, 'Local thresholding')` displays the resulting binary image after applying local thresholding.

This code will allow you to apply and visualize the effect of local thresholding on the image.
