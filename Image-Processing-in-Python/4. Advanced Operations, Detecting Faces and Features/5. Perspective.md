# Perspective

erspective
In this exercise, you will detect the corners of a building using the Harris corner detector. The threshold_rel parameter will specify the minimum intensity of peaks.

Building from a bottom perspective
Image preloaded as building_image.
The functions show_image() and show_image_with_corners() have already been preloaded for you. As well as the color module for converting images to grayscale.

Instructions
100 XP
Import the corner_harris() function from the feature module.
Convert the building_image to grayscale.
Apply the harris detector to obtain the measure response image with the possible corners.
Find the peaks of the corners.

```py
# Import the corner detector related functions and module
from skimage.____ import ____, corner_peaks

# Convert image from RGB-3 to grayscale
building_image_gray = ____

# Apply the detector  to measure the possible corners
measure_image = ____

# Find the peaks of the corners using the Harris detector
coords = ____(____, min_distance=20, threshold_rel=0.02)

# Show original and resulting image with corners detected
show_image(building_image, "Original")
show_image_with_corners(building_image, coords)

```

To complete the exercise for detecting corners of a building using the Harris corner detector, you can fill in the blanks as follows:

```python
# Import the corner detector related functions and module
from skimage.feature import corner_harris, corner_peaks

# Convert image from RGB-3 to grayscale
building_image_gray = color.rgb2gray(building_image)

# Apply the detector to measure the possible corners
measure_image = corner_harris(building_image_gray)

# Find the peaks of the corners using the Harris detector
coords = corner_peaks(measure_image, min_distance=20, threshold_rel=0.02)

# Show original and resulting image with corners detected
show_image(building_image, "Original")
show_image_with_corners(building_image, coords)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Importing Functions**: 
   - `corner_harris` is imported from `skimage.feature`, and `corner_peaks` is imported to find the peaks in the Harris response.
   
2. **Converting to Grayscale**:
   - `building_image_gray = color.rgb2gray(building_image)` converts the RGB image to a grayscale image, which is necessary for corner detection.
   
3. **Applying Harris Detector**:
   - `measure_image = corner_harris(building_image_gray)` applies the Harris corner detection algorithm to the grayscale image, producing a response image that highlights potential corners.
   
4. **Finding Corners**:
   - `coords = corner_peaks(measure_image, min_distance=20, threshold_rel=0.02)` finds the coordinates of the corners in the response image based on the specified minimum distance between peaks and a relative threshold for peak intensity.
   
5. **Displaying Results**:
   - `show_image(building_image, "Original")` displays the original building image.
   - `show_image_with_corners(building_image, coords)` displays the original image with the detected corners overlaid.

By running this code, you should be able to detect and visualize the corners of the building in the provided image. If you need further assistance or explanations, feel free to ask!
