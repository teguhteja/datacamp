# Less corners

Less corners
In this exercise, you will test what happens when you set the minimum distance between corner peaks to be a higher number. Remember you do this with the min_distance attribute parameter of the corner_peaks() function. The threshold_rel parameter will specify the minimum intensity of peaks.

Building from a bottom perspective
Image preloaded as building_image.
The functions show_image(), show_image_with_corners() and required packages have already been preloaded for you. As well as all the previous code for finding the corners. The Harris measure response image obtained with corner_harris() is preloaded as measure_image.

1
Find the peaks of the corners with a minimum distance of 10 pixels.

2
Find the peaks of the corners with a minimum distance of 60 pixels.

3
Show original and resulting image with corners detected.

To complete the exercise where you test the effect of setting a higher minimum distance between corner peaks, you can fill in the blanks as follows:

```python
# Find the peaks with a min distance of 10 pixels
coords_w_min_10 = corner_peaks(measure_image, min_distance=10, threshold_rel=0.02)
print("With a min_distance set to 10, we detect a total", len(coords_w_min_10), "corners in the image.")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Finding Peaks**:
   - `coords_w_min_10 = corner_peaks(measure_image, min_distance=10, threshold_rel=0.02)` uses the `corner_peaks()` function to find corner coordinates from the `measure_image` with a minimum distance of 10 pixels between detected corners. The `threshold_rel` parameter specifies the minimum intensity threshold relative to the maximum response value.

2. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the number of detected corners with the specified minimum distance.

### Follow-Up Steps:
2. For the second instruction (to find peaks with a minimum distance of 60 pixels), you would repeat the process with `min_distance=60`:

```python
# Find the peaks with a min distance of 60 pixels
coords_w_min_60 = corner_peaks(measure_image, min_distance=60, threshold_rel=0.02)
print("With a min_distance set to 60, we detect a total", len(coords_w_min_60), "corners in the image.")
```

3. Finally, to display the original image and the resulting image with detected corners, you can use the preloaded functions:

```python
# Show original and resulting image with corners detected for both min distances
show_image(building_image, "Original")
show_image_with_corners(building_image, coords_w_min_10)
show_image_with_corners(building_image, coords_w_min_60)
```

This sequence will allow you to compare how the minimum distance affects the number of detected corners in the building image. If you need further help, feel free to ask!

The error message you're seeing indicates that the function `show_image` is not defined in your current scope. This can happen if the function wasn't imported or initialized properly before you tried to use it. Here’s how you can fix this issue:

### Steps to Fix the Issue

1. **Ensure that Functions are Preloaded**: 
   - Confirm that the functions `show_image` and `show_image_with_corners` are indeed preloaded and available for use. If you are in a notebook or script that doesn’t have these functions defined, you will need to import or define them.

2. **Check Imports**: 
   - Make sure that you have imported any necessary modules at the beginning of your script. For instance, if you're using `show_image` from `skimage`, you should have something like:
     ```python
     from skimage import io
     ```

3. **Define `show_image` Function**: 
   - If `show_image` is not available, you can define it yourself. Here's a simple implementation using Matplotlib:
     ```python
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

     def show_image(image, title="Image"):
         plt.imshow(image, cmap='gray')
         plt.title(title)
         plt.axis('off')
         plt.show()
     ```

4. **Running Your Code**: 
   - After ensuring the function is available, try running the code again. Here’s a complete example integrating everything together, assuming that `show_image` is defined:
   
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from skimage import io, color, feature

# Define the show_image function if not preloaded
def show_image(image, title="Image"):
    plt.imshow(image, cmap='gray')
    plt.title(title)
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()

# Load your building image (replace 'path_to_image' with the actual image path)
building_image = io.imread('path_to_image/building_image.jpg')  # Update the path to your image
building_image_gray = color.rgb2gray(building_image)

# Harris corner detection
measure_image = feature.corner_harris(building_image_gray)
coords_w_min_10 = feature.corner_peaks(measure_image, min_distance=10, threshold_rel=0.02)
coords_w_min_60 = feature.corner_peaks(measure_image, min_distance=60, threshold_rel=0.02)

# Show original and resulting image with corners detected
show_image(building_image, "Original")
show_image_with_corners(building_image, coords_w_min_10)  # Ensure this function is defined as well
show_image_with_corners(building_image, coords_w_min_60)
```

### Additional Notes:
- If you have any dependencies that are not installed, make sure to install them using pip (e.g., `pip install scikit-image matplotlib`).
- The paths to your images should be correct, or else you'll encounter file not found errors.
- Ensure you have already executed any previous necessary cells if you're in a notebook environment.
