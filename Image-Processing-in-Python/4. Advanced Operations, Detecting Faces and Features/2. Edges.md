# Edges

Edges
In this exercise you will identify the shapes in a grapefruit image by detecting the edges, using the Canny algorithm.

Grapefruits
Image preloaded as grapefruit.
The color module has already been preloaded for you.

Instructions
100 XP
Import the canny edge detector from the feature module.
Convert the image to grayscale, using the method from the color module used in previous chapters.
Apply the canny edge detector to the grapefruit image.


```py
# Import the canny edge detector 
from skimage.____ import ____

# Convert image to grayscale
grapefruit = ____(____)

# Apply canny edge detector
canny_edges = ____

# Show resulting image
show_image(canny_edges, "Edges with Canny")
```

To identify the shapes in the grapefruit image using the Canny edge detection algorithm, you can complete the code as follows:

```python
# Import the canny edge detector 
from skimage.feature import canny

# Convert image to grayscale
grapefruit = color.rgb2gray(grapefruit)

# Apply canny edge detector
canny_edges = canny(grapefruit)

# Show resulting image
show_image(canny_edges, "Edges with Canny")
```

### Explanation:
1. **`from skimage.feature import canny`**: This imports the Canny edge detection function from the feature module.
2. **`grapefruit = color.rgb2gray(grapefruit)`**: This line converts the color image of the grapefruit into a grayscale image, which is necessary for edge detection.
3. **`canny_edges = canny(grapefruit)`**: This applies the Canny edge detector to the grayscale image, producing a binary image where edges are represented as white pixels against a black background.
4. **`show_image(canny_edges, "Edges with Canny")`**: This displays the resulting edge-detected image.

When you run this code, it will show you the edges detected in the grapefruit image. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to ask!
