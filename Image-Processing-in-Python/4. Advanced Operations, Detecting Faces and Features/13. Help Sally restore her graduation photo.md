# Help Sally restore her graduation photo

Help Sally restore her graduation photo
You are going to combine all the knowledge you acquired throughout the course to complete a final challenge: reconstructing a very damaged photo.

Help Sally restore her favorite portrait which was damaged by noise, distortion, and missing information due to a breach in her laptop.

Sally damaged picture
Sally's damaged portrait is already loaded as damaged_image.
You will be fixing the problems of this image by:

Rotating it to be uprightusing rotate()
Applying noise reduction with denoise_tv_chambolle()
Reconstructing the damaged parts with inpaint_biharmonic() from the inpaint module.
show_image() is already preloaded.

Instructions
100 XP
Import the necessary module to apply restoration on the image.
Rotate the image by calling the function rotate().
Use the chambolle algorithm to remove the noise from the image.
With the mask provided, use the biharmonic method to restore the missing parts of the image and obtain the final image.

```py
# Import the necessary modules
from skimage.restoration import denoise_tv_chambolle, ____
from skimage import transform

# Transform the image so it's not rotated
upright_img = ____(damaged_image, 20)

# Remove noise from the image, using the chambolle method
upright_img_without_noise = ____(upright_img,weight=0.1, multichannel=True)

# Reconstruct the image missing parts
mask = get_mask(upright_img)
result = ____.____(upright_img_without_noise, mask, multichannel=True)

show_image(result)

```

To help Sally restore her graduation photo, you can fill in the blanks in the provided code snippet as follows:

### Complete Code

```python
# Import the necessary modules
from skimage.restoration import denoise_tv_chambolle, inpaint_biharmonic
from skimage import transform

# Transform the image so it's not rotated
upright_img = transform.rotate(damaged_image, 20)

# Remove noise from the image, using the chambolle method
upright_img_without_noise = denoise_tv_chambolle(upright_img, weight=0.1, multichannel=True)

# Reconstruct the image missing parts
mask = get_mask(upright_img)
result = inpaint_biharmonic(upright_img_without_noise, mask, multichannel=True)

# Show the resulting image
show_image(result)
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Import Necessary Modules**: Import `denoise_tv_chambolle` for noise reduction and `inpaint_biharmonic` for reconstructing missing parts of the image. Import `transform` from `skimage` for image rotation.
   ```python
   from skimage.restoration import denoise_tv_chambolle, inpaint_biharmonic
   from skimage import transform
   ```

2. **Rotate the Image**: Use the `rotate()` function from the `transform` module to rotate the damaged image by 20 degrees to correct its orientation.
   ```python
   upright_img = transform.rotate(damaged_image, 20)
   ```

3. **Remove Noise**: Apply the Chambolle method to remove noise from the rotated image. The `weight` parameter controls the strength of the noise reduction, and `multichannel=True` indicates that the image has multiple color channels.
   ```python
   upright_img_without_noise = denoise_tv_chambolle(upright_img, weight=0.1, multichannel=True)
   ```

4. **Reconstruct Missing Parts**: Use the `get_mask()` function to obtain a mask of the damaged areas. Then, apply the biharmonic inpainting method to restore these areas in the noise-reduced image.
   ```python
   mask = get_mask(upright_img)
   result = inpaint_biharmonic(upright_img_without_noise, mask, multichannel=True)
   ```

5. **Show the Resulting Image**: Finally, display the restored image using the `show_image()` function.
   ```python
   show_image(result)
   ```

### Conclusion

This approach combines rotation, noise reduction, and inpainting techniques to restore Sally's damaged portrait effectively. If you have any further questions or need additional help, feel free to ask!
