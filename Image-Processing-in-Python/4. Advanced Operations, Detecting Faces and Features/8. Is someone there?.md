# Is someone there?

Is someone there?
In this exercise, you will check whether or not there is a person present in an image taken at night.

Image preloaded as night_image.
The Cascade of classifiers class from feature module has been already imported. The same is true for the show_detected_face() function, that is used to display the face marked in the image and crop so it can be shown separately.

Instructions
100 XP
Load the trained file from the data module.
Initialize the detector cascade with the trained file.
Detect the faces in the image, setting the minimum size of the searching window to 10 pixels and 200 pixels for the maximum.

```py
# Load the trained file from data
trained_file = ____.lbp_frontal_face_cascade_filename()

# Initialize the detector cascade
detector = ____(____)

# Detect faces with min and max size of searching window
detected = detector.detect_multi_scale(img = night_image,
                                       scale_factor=1.2,
                                       step_ratio=1,
                                       min_size=(____),
                                       max_size=(____))

# Show the detected faces
show_detected_face(night_image, detected)


```

The error message you're encountering indicates that the `feature` module has not been properly imported in your code, which is causing the `NameError` when you try to initialize the detector.

Hereâ€™s how to properly set up your code with the necessary imports and correctly initialize the face detector using the Cascade classifier:

### Complete Code with Proper Imports

```python
# Import necessary modules
from skimage import feature, data  # Make sure to import the necessary modules
from skimage.io import imshow  # Import the imshow function if needed for displaying images

# Load the trained file from data
trained_file = data.lbp_frontal_face_cascade_filename()

# Initialize the detector cascade
detector = feature.Cascade(trained_file)

# Detect faces with min and max size of searching window
detected = detector.detect_multi_scale(img=night_image,
                                       scale_factor=1.2,
                                       step_ratio=1,
                                       min_size=(10, 10),  # minimum size of 10 pixels
                                       max_size=(200, 200))  # maximum size of 200 pixels

# Show the detected faces
show_detected_face(night_image, detected)
```

### Explanation of Key Points

1. **Importing the feature module**: Ensure you import the `feature` module correctly from `skimage`, as it contains the `Cascade` class required for face detection.
2. **Function Availability**: If you need to visualize the image or detected faces, ensure you have the appropriate `imshow` function or equivalent for displaying images.
3. **Face Detection Functionality**: If `show_detected_face` is not defined in your context, make sure you have a function that can visualize the detected faces on the original image. You might implement it similar to `imshow`, marking the rectangles around detected faces.

### Example of `show_detected_face` Function

Here is an example of how you could implement the `show_detected_face` function if you don't already have it:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.patches as patches

def show_detected_face(image, detected):
    plt.imshow(image)
    ax = plt.gca()
    
    for (x, y, width, height) in detected:
        rect = patches.Rectangle((x, y), width, height, linewidth=2, edgecolor='r', facecolor='none')
        ax.add_patch(rect)

    plt.axis('off')  # Hide axes
    plt.show()
```

### Final Steps

1. Ensure all necessary modules are imported at the beginning of your script.
2. Use the provided code snippets to integrate face detection successfully.
