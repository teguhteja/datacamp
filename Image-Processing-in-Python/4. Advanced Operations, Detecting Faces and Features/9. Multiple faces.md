# Multiple faces

Multiple faces
In this exercise, you will detect multiple faces in an image and show them individually. Think of this as a way to create a dataset of your own friends' faces!

A group of 7 friends
Image preloaded as friends_image.
The Cascade of classifiers class from feature module has already been imported, as well as the show_detected_face() function which is used to display the face marked in the image and crop it so it can be shown separately.

Load the trained file .lbp_frontal_face_cascade_filename(). from the data module.
Initialize the detector cascade with trained file.
Detect the faces in the image, setting a scale_factor of 1.2 and step_ratio of 1.

```py
# Load the trained file from data
trained_file = ____.___()

# Initialize the detector cascade
detector = ____

# Detect faces with scale factor to 1.2 and step ratio to 1
detected = detector.____(img=friends_image,
                                       scale_factor=____,
                                       step_ratio=____,
                                       min_size=(10, 10),
                                       max_size=(200, 200))
# Show the detected faces
show_detected_face(friends_image, detected)

```

To detect multiple faces in an image of your friends using the Cascade classifier, you can fill in the blanks in the provided code as follows:

### Complete Code

```python
from skimage import feature, data  # Make sure to import the necessary modules
from skimage.io import imshow  # Import the imshow function if needed for displaying images
# Load the trained file from data
trained_file = data.lbp_frontal_face_cascade_filename()

# Initialize the detector cascade
detector = feature.Cascade(trained_file)

# Detect faces with scale factor to 1.2 and step ratio to 1
detected = detector.detect_multi_scale(img=friends_image,
                                       scale_factor=1.2,
                                       step_ratio=1,
                                       min_size=(10, 10),
                                       max_size=(200, 200))

# Show the detected faces
show_detected_face(friends_image, detected)
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Load the trained file**: The trained file for the frontal face detection is loaded from the `data` module of `skimage`.
   ```python
   trained_file = data.lbp_frontal_face_cascade_filename()
   ```

2. **Initialize the detector**: The `Cascade` class is initialized with the trained file, allowing it to detect faces in images.
   ```python
   detector = feature.Cascade(trained_file)
   ```

3. **Detect faces**: The `detect_multi_scale` method is called on the detector object, where:
   - `img` is the image containing friends' faces.
   - `scale_factor` determines how much the image size is reduced at each image scale.
   - `step_ratio` is the ratio of the steps taken between two adjacent scales. A value of 1 means no overlap.
   - `min_size` and `max_size` specify the smallest and largest faces to detect in the image.
   ```python
   detected = detector.detect_multi_scale(img=friends_image,
                                          scale_factor=1.2,
                                          step_ratio=1,
                                          min_size=(10, 10),
                                          max_size=(200, 200))
   ```

4. **Display detected faces**: Finally, the `show_detected_face` function is called to display the image with the detected faces.
   ```python
   show_detected_face(friends_image, detected)
   ```

### Conclusion

With this setup, your code will successfully detect and display multiple faces from the `friends_image`. Make sure that all required imports and the `show_detected_face` function are correctly implemented to visualize the results effectively. Let me know if you need further assistance!
