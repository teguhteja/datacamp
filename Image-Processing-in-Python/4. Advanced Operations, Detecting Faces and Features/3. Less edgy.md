# Less edgy

Less edgy
Let's now try to spot just the outer shape of the grapefruits, the circles. You can do this by applying a more intense Gaussian filter to first make the image smoother. This can be achieved by specifying a bigger sigma in the canny function.

In this exercise, you'll experiment with sigma values of the canny() function.

2
Apply the canny edge detector to the grapefruit image with a sigma of 2.2.

3
Show the resulting images.

```py
# Apply canny edge detector with a sigma of 1.8
canny_edges = canny(grapefruit, sigma=____)
```

To apply the Canny edge detector to the grapefruit image with a sigma of 1.8, you can complete the code as follows:

```python
# Apply canny edge detector with a sigma of 1.8
canny_edges_1_8 = canny(grapefruit, sigma=1.8)

# Apply canny edge detector with a sigma of 2.2
canny_edges_2_2 = canny(grapefruit, sigma=2.2)

# Show the resulting images
show_image(canny_edges_1_8, "Canny Edges with Sigma 1.8")
show_image(canny_edges_2_2, "Canny Edges with Sigma 2.2")
```

### Explanation:
1. **`canny_edges_1_8 = canny(grapefruit, sigma=1.8)`**: This applies the Canny edge detector with a sigma of 1.8, resulting in a smoother edge detection that should highlight the outer shapes of the grapefruits more effectively.
2. **`canny_edges_2_2 = canny(grapefruit, sigma=2.2)`**: This applies the Canny edge detector with a sigma of 2.2, further increasing the smoothing effect and potentially enhancing the detection of circular shapes.
3. **`show_image(canny_edges_1_8, "Canny Edges with Sigma 1.8")`** and **`show_image(canny_edges_2_2, "Canny Edges with Sigma 2.2")`**: These lines display the edge-detected images for both sigma values, allowing for a visual comparison of how the changes in sigma affect the detection of edges.

By running this code, you will be able to see the differences in edge detection results based on the specified sigma values. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
