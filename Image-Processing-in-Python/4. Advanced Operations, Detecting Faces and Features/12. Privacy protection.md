# Privacy protection

Privacy protection
Let's look at a real-world application of what you have learned in the course.

In this exercise, you will detect human faces in the image and for the sake of privacy, you will anonymize data by blurring people's faces in the image automatically.

Group band walking
Image preloaded as group_image.
You can use the gaussian filter for the blurriness.

The face detector is ready to use as detector and all packages needed have been imported.

Instructions
100 XP
Detect the faces in the image using the detector, set the minimum size of the searching window to 10 by 10 pixels.
Go through each detected face with a for loop.
Apply a gaussian filter to detect and blur faces, using a sigma of 8.

```py
# Detect the faces
detected = ____.____(img=____, 
                                       scale_factor=1.2, step_ratio=1, 
                                       min_size=____, max_size=(100, 100))
# For each detected face
for d in ____:  
    # Obtain the face rectangle from detected coordinates
    face = getFaceRectangle(d)
    
    # Apply gaussian filter to extracted face
    blurred_face = ____(face, multichannel=____, sigma = ____)
    
    # Merge this blurry face to our final image and show it
    resulting_image = mergeBlurryFace(group_image, blurred_face) 
show_image(resulting_image, "Blurred faces")
```

To implement privacy protection by blurring faces in an image, you can fill in the blanks in the provided code snippet as follows:

### Complete Code

```python
# Detect the faces
detected = detector.detect_multi_scale(img=group_image, 
                                       scale_factor=1.2, 
                                       step_ratio=1, 
                                       min_size=(10, 10), 
                                       max_size=(100, 100))

# For each detected face
for d in detected:  
    # Obtain the face rectangle from detected coordinates
    face = getFaceRectangle(d)
    
    # Apply gaussian filter to extracted face
    blurred_face = gaussian(face, multichannel=True, sigma=8)
    
    # Merge this blurry face to our final image and show it
    resulting_image = mergeBlurryFace(group_image, blurred_face) 

# Show the resulting image
show_image(resulting_image, "Blurred faces")
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Detect Faces**: Use the `detect_multi_scale()` method of the detector to find faces in the `group_image`. The parameters specify the scale factor, step ratio, and minimum and maximum sizes of faces to detect.
   ```python
   detected = detector.detect_multi_scale(img=group_image, 
                                          scale_factor=1.2, 
                                          step_ratio=1, 
                                          min_size=(10, 10), 
                                          max_size=(100, 100))
   ```

2. **Loop Through Detected Faces**: Iterate over each detected face in the `detected` list.
   ```python
   for d in detected:  
   ```

3. **Obtain Face Rectangle**: Use the `getFaceRectangle()` function to obtain the rectangular coordinates of each detected face.
   ```python
   face = getFaceRectangle(d)
   ```

4. **Apply Gaussian Filter**: Use the `gaussian()` function to blur the face using a sigma value of 8. The `multichannel=True` parameter indicates that the input is a color image.
   ```python
   blurred_face = gaussian(face, multichannel=True, sigma=8)
   ```

5. **Merge Blurry Face**: Use the `mergeBlurryFace()` function to replace the original face in the `group_image` with the blurred version.
   ```python
   resulting_image = mergeBlurryFace(group_image, blurred_face)
   ```

6. **Show the Resulting Image**: Finally, display the resulting image with blurred faces using the `show_image()` function.
   ```python
   show_image(resulting_image, "Blurred faces")
   ```
