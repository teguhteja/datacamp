# Amazing work!

1. Amazing work!
00:00 - 00:11
Amazing work! You have reached the final video. During the course you have learned many concepts and practiced a lot along the way, solving real-world problems.

2. Recap: What you have learned
00:11 - 00:51
From improving images' contrast to restoring damaged ones with very few lines! You also applied filters, rotated, flipped and resized images, segmented using supervised and unsupervised methods, and improved this segmentation using morphological operators! You created and reduced noise, detected edges, corners and faces, and mixed them up to solve difficult challenges! You will now be able to apply these techniques to many other use cases and keep extending your computer vision knowledge!

3. What's next?
00:51 - 01:07
So you have learned many useful methods that will let you process images with scikit-image or other image processing libraries. Like Open CV. We focused on many fundamental concepts so you can continue your progress from a practical experienced point. Some things that we didn't cover are tinting gray scale images, matching or approximation. Since it's a very large field, there are many more techniques for you to play around with!

4. Congrats!
