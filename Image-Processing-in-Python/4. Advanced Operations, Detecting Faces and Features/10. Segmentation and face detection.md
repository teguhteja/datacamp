# Segmentation and face detection

Segmentation and face detection
Previously, you learned how to make processes more computationally efficient with unsupervised superpixel segmentation. In this exercise, you'll do just that!

Using the slic() function for segmentation, pre-process the image before passing it to the face detector.

Image preloaded as profile_image.
The Cascade class, the slic() function from segmentation module, and the show_detected_face() function for visualization have already been imported. The detector is already initialized and ready to use as detector.

Apply superpixel segmentation and obtain the segments a.k.a. labels using slic().
Obtain the segmented image using label2rgb(), passing the segments and profile_image.
Detect the faces, using the detector with multi scale method.

```py
# Obtain the segmentation with default 100 regions
segments = ____

# Obtain segmented image using label2rgb
segmented_image = ____(____, ____, kind='avg')

# Detect the faces with multi scale method
detected = detector.____(img=____, 
                                       scale_factor=1.2, 
                                       step_ratio=1, 
                                       min_size=(10, 10), max_size=(1000, 1000))

# Show the detected faces
show_detected_face(segmented_image, detected)
```

To perform superpixel segmentation on an image and then detect faces using the initialized detector, you can fill in the blanks in the provided code snippet as follows:

### Complete Code

```python
from skimage import feature, data  # Make sure to import the necessary modules
from skimage.io import imshow  # Import the imshow function if needed for displaying images
# Obtain the segmentation with default 100 regions
segments = slic(profile_image, n_segments=100)

# Obtain segmented image using label2rgb
segmented_image = label2rgb(segments, profile_image, kind='avg')

# Detect the faces with multi scale method
detected = detector.detect_multi_scale(img=segmented_image, 
                                       scale_factor=1.2, 
                                       step_ratio=1, 
                                       min_size=(10, 10), 
                                       max_size=(1000, 1000))

# Show the detected faces
show_detected_face(segmented_image, detected)
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Obtain Segmentation**: Use the `slic()` function to apply superpixel segmentation to the `profile_image`. The `n_segments=100` parameter specifies that the image should be divided into 100 regions.
   ```python
   segments = slic(profile_image, n_segments=100)
   ```

2. **Obtain Segmented Image**: Convert the segments into a segmented image using `label2rgb()`. The `kind='avg'` parameter indicates that the average color of each segment should be used.
   ```python
   segmented_image = label2rgb(segments, profile_image, kind='avg')
   ```

3. **Detect Faces**: Use the `detect_multi_scale` method of the detector to find faces in the `segmented_image`. The parameters specify the scale factor, step ratio, and the minimum and maximum sizes of faces to detect.
   ```python
   detected = detector.detect_multi_scale(img=segmented_image, 
                                          scale_factor=1.2, 
                                          step_ratio=1, 
                                          min_size=(10, 10), 
                                          max_size=(1000, 1000))
   ```

4. **Show Detected Faces**: Finally, call the `show_detected_face` function to visualize the detected faces in the segmented image.
   ```python
   show_detected_face(segmented_image, detected)
   ```

### Conclusion

This process efficiently segments the image into superpixels, which can enhance the performance of the face detection algorithm by reducing the computational load and focusing on the most relevant features in the image. Let me know if you need further assistance or clarification!
